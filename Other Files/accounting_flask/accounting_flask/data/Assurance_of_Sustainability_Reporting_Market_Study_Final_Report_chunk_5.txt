for FTSE 350 companies in 2023 involving limited assurance over some, or all, of the metrics being assured. Demand for sustainability assurance All stakeholders reported a growing demand for sustainability assurance, with an increasing number of companies seeking to provide confidence to stakeholders on a variety of different sustainability metrics they are reporting. 1 The data used in Figures 4 and 5 of this report relating to assurance engagements carried out between 2019 and 2022, by audit and non-audit assurance providers, has been revised since the publication of the FRC’s emerging findings in October 2024. Figure 1 shows that between 2019 and 2023, there was an 18-percentage point increase in the number of FTSE 350 companies obtaining sustainability assurance. This equates to 62 additional companies obtaining assurance between 2019 and 2023, as show in Figure 2.2 Figure 1.
