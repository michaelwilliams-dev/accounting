estimate. If we estimate the liability to make payments that should have been shown on the return, we’ll also send you an assessment for any CIS deductions that should have been paid. There are some circumstances when different rules may apply to the way we work out these penalties. For more information see below. When we may cap the total amount of £100 and £200 fixed penalties When a contractor first files a CIS return, and has not previously filed any CIS returns for earlier periods we’ll cap the total amount of £100 and £200 fixed penalties that we charge for that first and earlier returns to a maximum of £3,000. We will not cap penalties for returns that are due for any later periods. The rules for capping only apply to monthly CIS returns due to be filed on or after 19 November 2011. How we decide the amount of penalty we charge when a return is more than 6 months and 12 months late Once a return is 6 months and 12 months late, we normally automatically charge a penalty of £300 or 5% of any liability to make payments that should have been shown on the return. The amount of this penalty will be based on the information we hold at the time. When we receive the return or if we receive any further information that may affect the amount of penalty due, we may need to change the amount of penalty that we’ve charged. For example, if we’ve automatically charged £300 and your late return shows a liability to make payments that is more than £6,000 we would increase the amount of the penalty. This is because 5% would be more than £300. When a return is 12 months late we also need to consider whether
