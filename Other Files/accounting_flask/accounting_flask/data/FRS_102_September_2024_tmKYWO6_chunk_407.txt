an entity: buys or sells goods or services whose price is denominated in a foreign currency; borrows or lends funds when the amounts payable or receivable are denominated in a foreign currency; or otherwise acquires or disposes of assets, or incurs or settles liabilities, denominated in a foreign currency. An entity shall record a foreign currency transaction, on initial recognition in the functional currency, by applying to the foreign currency amount the spot exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction. The date of a transaction is the date on which the transaction first qualifies for recognition in accordance with this FRS. For practical reasons, a rate that approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction is often used, for example, an average rate for a week or a month might be used for all transactions in each foreign currency occurring during that period. However, if exchange rates fluctuate significantly, the use of the average rate for a period is inappropriate. Reporting at the end of the subsequent reporting periods At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall: translate foreign currency monetary items using the closing rate; translate non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction; and translate non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. An entity shall recognise, in profit or loss in the period in which they arise, exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous periods,
