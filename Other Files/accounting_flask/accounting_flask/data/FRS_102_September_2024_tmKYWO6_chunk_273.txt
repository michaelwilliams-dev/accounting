in a contract or implicitly at the time it is made available for use by the customer. Even if an asset is specified, there is no identified asset if the supplier has a substantive right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use. A supplierâ€™s right to substitute the asset is substantive only if it both: has the practical ability to substitute alternative assets throughout the period of use; and would benefit economically from doing so. Evaluation of substitution rights is based on facts and circumstances at the inception date and shall exclude consideration of future events that, at that date, are not considered likely to occur. If the customer cannot readily determine whether the supplier has a substantive substitution right, the customer shall presume that it does not. A portion of an asset can be an identified asset if it is physically distinct (eg a floor of a building). A portion of an asset that is not physically distinct (eg a capacity portion of a fibre optic cable) cannot be an identified asset, unless it represents substantially all of the capacity of the asset and thereby provides the customer with the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset. Right to obtain economic benefits from use To control the use of an identified asset, a customer is required to have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use. A customer can obtain economic benefits from the use of an asset directly or indirectly in many ways, such as by using, holding or subleasing the asset. The economic benefits from use of an asset include its primary output and by-products (including potential cash flows derived from these items), and other economic
