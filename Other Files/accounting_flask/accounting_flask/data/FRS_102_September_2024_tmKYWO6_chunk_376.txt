be measured directly. Therefore, the recoverable amount of goodwill must be derived from measurement of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit(s) of which the goodwill is a part. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination shall, from the acquisition date, be allocated to each of the acquirerâ€™s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Part of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is attributable to the non-controlling interest in goodwill. For the purpose of impairment testing of a non-wholly-owned cash-generating unit with goodwill, the carrying amount of that unit is notionally adjusted, before being compared with its recoverable amount, by grossing up the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the unit to include the goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interest. This notionally adjusted carrying amount is then compared with the recoverable amount of the unit to determine whether the cash-generating unit is impaired. If goodwill cannot be allocated to individual cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units) on a non-arbitrary basis, then for the purposes of testing goodwill the entity shall test the impairment of goodwill by determining the recoverable amount of either: the acquired entity in its entirety, if the goodwill relates to an acquired entity that has not been integrated. Integrated means the acquired business has been restructured or dissolved into the reporting entity or other subsidiaries; or the entire group of entities, excluding any entities that have not been integrated, if the goodwill relates to an entity that has been integrated. In applying this paragraph, an entity will need to separate goodwill into goodwill relating to entities that have been integrated and goodwill relating to entities that have not
