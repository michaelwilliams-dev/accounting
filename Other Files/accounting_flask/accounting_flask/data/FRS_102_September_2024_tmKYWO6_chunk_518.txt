would be to increase reserves and create an asset (goodwill). A3.21 In the rare cases where the method for calculating goodwill set out in the Regulations and in paragraph 9.19B of FRS 102 would be misleading, the goodwill should be calculated as the sum of goodwill arising from each purchase of an interest in the relevant undertaking adjusted as necessary for any subsequent impairment. Goodwill arising on each purchase should be calculated as the difference between the cost of that purchase and the fair value at the date of that purchase of the identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to the interest purchased. The difference between the goodwill calculated using this method and that calculated using the method provided by the Regulations and FRS 102 is shown in reserves. Section 404(5) of the Act sets out the disclosures required in cases where the statutory requirement is not applied. Paragraph 3.5 of FRS 102 sets out the disclosures when an entity departs from a requirement of FRS 102 or from a requirement of applicable legislation. Netting A3.22 FRS 102 permits an expense relating to a provision to be presented net of the amount recognised for a reimbursement (which may only be recognised if it is virtually certain it will be received) (see paragraph 21.9 of FRS 102). Paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations requires that ‘Amounts in respect of items representing assets or income may not be set off against amounts in respect of items representing liabilities or expenditure (as the case may be), or vice versa.’ The reimbursement asset is recognised separately from the underlying obligation to reflect the fact that the entity often will continue to be liable if the third party from which the reimbursement is due fails to pay. On the other hand, the net presentation
