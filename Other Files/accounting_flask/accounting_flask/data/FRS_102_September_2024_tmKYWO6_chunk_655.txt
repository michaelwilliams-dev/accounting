public benefit entities. In particular, a criterion has been added to include consideration of the impact of the combination on beneficiaries and the benefits to which they are entitled. B34J.5 One specific concern highlighted in relation to the requirements of FRS 6, is the need to restate comparatives by adding together the previous periods’ reported figures of each of the combining entities. This does not reflect the substance of the transaction as the historical parties which formed the entity did not exist as a single entity in the previous accounting period and therefore FRS 102 requires comparatives to be marked as ‘combined’ to make it clear that they are a combination of previously reported figures for the combining entities. B34J.6 In July 2015, as part of the implementation of the EU Accounting Directive, this section was amended to clarify that a public benefit entity may apply merger accounting to an entity combination that is a merger provided that it is permitted by the statutory framework under which it reports. Company Law only permits companies to apply merger accounting for group reconstructions and this amendment to FRS 102 was made to ensure merger accounting is not applied by public benefit entities that are companies when not permitted in law. Some respondents suggested that FRS 102 should continue to require the use of merger accounting by all public benefit entity combinations meeting the definition and criteria of a merger, through requiring the use of the true and fair override. It was noted that ‘true mergers’ (other than those that might be considered group reconstructions) are not likely to be common. However, Appendix III Note on legal requirements notes that an individual public benefit entity may apply the true and fair override if it considers it appropriate to its circumstances, and provides the
