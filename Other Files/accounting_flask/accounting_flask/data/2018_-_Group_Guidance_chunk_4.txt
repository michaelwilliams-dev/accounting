nature and extent of the review of the component auditor’s work – this is a matter of judgment. This judgement should reflect: the extent to which the GET has been able to evaluate and review the work performed by the CET and the results obtained; the GET’s experience of review of the CET in prior periods; the relative significance of the component; and the nature of risks relevant to that component. The review of the component auditor’s work will also contribute to meeting the requirement to obtain SAAE on which to base the group audit opinion. Where a component is financially significant,8 the GET is more likely to determine it necessary to review relatively more of the component auditor's working papers. Where a component is significant due to certain account balances, classes of transactions or disclosures relating to significant risks of material misstatement of the group financial statements,9 the GET would likely focus their review on audit documentation for these areas. Where a component is Material but Not Significant, the GET would likely limit their review to audit documentation that is relevant to the significant risks of material misstatement of the group financial statements. EQCR review For public interest entities, the ISAs (UK) also require an engagement quality control review to be performed to assess whether the KAP(s) could reasonably have come to the opinion and conclusions expressed in the draft of the group auditor's report and the additional report to the audit committee.10 As part of that review, the EQCR is required to consider certain elements of the group audit, including the significant risks relevant to the audit identified by the KAPs, the measures taken to adequately manage those risks and the reasoning of the KAPs with regard to those significant risks.11 The EQCR is also required to discuss
