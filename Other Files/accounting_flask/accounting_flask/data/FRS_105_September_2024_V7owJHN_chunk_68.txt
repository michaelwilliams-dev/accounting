to ownership. Whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating lease depends on the substance of the transaction rather than the form of the contract. Examples of situations that individually or in combination would normally lead to a lease being classified as a finance lease are: the lease transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term; the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a price that is expected to be sufficiently lower than the fair value at the date the option becomes exercisable for it to be reasonably certain, at the inception of the lease, that the option will be exercised; the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset even if title is not transferred; at the inception of the lease the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset; and the leased assets are of such a specialised nature that only the lessee can use them without major modifications. Indicators of situations that individually or in combination could also lead to a lease being classified as a finance lease are: if the lessee can cancel the lease, the lessorâ€™s losses associated with the cancellation are borne by the lessee; gains or losses from the fluctuation in the residual value of the leased asset accrue to the lessee (eg in the form of a rent rebate equalling most of the sales proceeds at the end of the lease); and the lessee has the ability to continue the lease for a secondary period at a rent that is substantially lower than market rent. The examples and indicators in paragraphs 15.6 and 15.7 are not always conclusive. If it is
