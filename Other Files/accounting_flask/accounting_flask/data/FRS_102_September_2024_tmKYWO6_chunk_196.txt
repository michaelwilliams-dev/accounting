hedging instrument shall be recognised in profit or loss; and the hedging gain or loss on the hedged item shall adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item (if applicable) and be recognised in profit or loss. When a hedged item is an unrecognised firm commitment, the cumulative hedging gain or loss on the hedged item is recognised as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. When an unrecognised firm commitment to acquire an asset or assume a liability is the hedged item, the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability that results from the entity meeting the firm commitment is adjusted to include the cumulative hedging gain or loss of the hedged item that was recognised in the statement of financial position. Any adjustment arising from paragraph 12.20(b) shall be amortised to profit or loss if the hedged item is a financial instrument measured at amortised cost. Amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for hedging gains and losses. The amortisation is based on a recalculated effective interest rate at the date amortisation begins. Cash flow hedges A cash flow hedge shall be accounted for as follows from the date the conditions in paragraph 12.18 are met: the separate component of equity associated with the hedged item (cash flow hedge reserve) is adjusted to the lower of the following (in absolute amounts): the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument from the date the conditions of paragraph 12.18 are met; and the cumulative change in fair value on the hedged item (ie the present value of the cumulative change of expected future cash flows) from the date the conditions of paragraph 12.18 are
