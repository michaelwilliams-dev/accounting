Consideration payable to a customer also includes credit or other items (eg a coupon or voucher) that can be applied against amounts owed to the entity (or to other parties that purchase the entity’s goods or services from the customer). An entity shall account for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of the transaction price and, therefore, of revenue unless the payment to the customer is in exchange for a distinct good or service (as described in paragraphs 23.21 to 23.25) that the customer transfers to the entity. If consideration payable to a customer is accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price, an entity shall recognise the reduction of revenue when (or as) the later of either of the following events occurs: the entity recognises revenue for the transfer of the related goods or services to the customer; and the entity pays or promises to pay the consideration (even if the payment is conditional on a future event). Step 4 – Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract An entity shall allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract on a relative stand-alone selling price basis in accordance with paragraphs 23.67 to 23.71, unless allocating discounts or variable amounts on an alternative basis in accordance with paragraphs 23.72 to 23.74. Paragraphs 23.67 to 23.74 do not apply if: a contract contains a single performance obligation; or all performance obligations in a contract are satisfied at the same point in time in accordance with paragraph 23.85. However, paragraph 23.74 applies if an entity accounts for a series of distinct goods or services as a single performance obligation in accordance with paragraph 23.18 and the consideration promised in the contract includes a variable amount.
