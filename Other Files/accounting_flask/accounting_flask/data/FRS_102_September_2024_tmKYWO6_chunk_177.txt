legal reasons relating to the debtor’s financial difficulty, granting to the debtor a concession that the creditor would not otherwise consider; it has become probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; and observable data indicating that there has been a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a group of financial assets since the initial recognition of those assets, even though the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets in the group, such as adverse national or local economic conditions or adverse changes in industry conditions. Other factors may also be evidence of impairment, including significant changes with an adverse effect that have taken place in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the issuer operates.

An entity shall assess other financial assets for impairment either individually or grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics. Measurement An entity shall measure an impairment loss on the following instruments measured at cost or amortised cost as follows: For an instrument measured at amortised cost in accordance with paragraph 11.14(a), the impairment loss is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. If such a financial instrument has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. For an instrument measured at cost less impairment in accordance with paragraph 11.14(c), (d)(i) or (d)(v) the impairment loss is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the best estimate (which will necessarily be an approximation) of the amount
