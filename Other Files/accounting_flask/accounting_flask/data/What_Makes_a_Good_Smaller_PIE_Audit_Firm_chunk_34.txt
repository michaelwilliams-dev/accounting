firm's strategy document, governance structures, minutes of meetings, internal communications, training materials, internal monitoring reports, RCA reports, and its quality and remediating plan. We will also reviews the firm's annual evaluation required by ISQM 1. • We test the application of certain policies and procedures and request evidence for selected samples. For example, appraisal and promotion documents, remuneration processes, results of IQM and RCA, ethics consultations, technical consultations. We may test some of the firm's internal controls within its system of quality management. We issue the firm with a report summarising our findings and recommendations (based on good practice we have identified at other firms) for discussion. The firm must develop remedial actions to address our findings. We also identify good practices that we have seen at the firm. We will discuss the firm's proposed actions, including timing. Once agreed, we will issue a final report to the firm. At a later date we may request evidence of these actions. Enforcement at the FRC Introduction and context The FRC’s Enforcement Division is responsible for investigating and taking enforcement action in relation to breaches of requirements or misconduct by auditors during the course of statutory audit work. The FRC’s primary regime for the enforcement of statutory audit-related matters is the AEP, introduced in 2016. Certain audit-related matters may also be investigated under the Scheme 4. Both the AEP and the Scheme differ significantly from the disciplinary schemes operated by the RSBs. The work of the FRC’s Enforcement Division is summarised and published annually in the Annual Enforcement Review (AER), usually in July. The AER provides a valuable insight into our approach to enforcement, the structure of the Enforcement Division, the outcomes of concluded investigations and the themes and trends identified. The most recent and previous AERs may be found here. In
