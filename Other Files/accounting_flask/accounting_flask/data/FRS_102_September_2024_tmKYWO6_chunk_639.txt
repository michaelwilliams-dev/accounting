16/14BL REVISED Guidance on donations by a company to its parent charity). B29.13 As a result, FRS 102 requires the gift aid payment to be accounted for as a distribution to owners. FRS 102 contains some specific requirements that are relevant to distributions to owners, for example paragraph 22.17 requires distributions to owners to be recognised in equity. When there are no specific requirements, paragraph 10.5 requires an entity to first have regard to any requirements dealing with similar and related issues.

B29.14 Just over half the respondents to this issue considered that a liability should be recognised at the reporting date for an expected gift aid payment, for example when there was past practice of making such payments. This is not consistent with FRS 102 and the FRC was not persuaded that this better reflects the substance of the transaction which, for accounting purposes, is a distribution to owners, and therefore no amendment has been made to FRS 102 in this regard. B29.15 Some respondents suggested that additional disclosure requirements be added to FRS 102 in order to provide information about any expected gift aid payment.
