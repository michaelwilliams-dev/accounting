we will continue to publish cross firm reviews in this area to stimulate best practice across audit firms, as we did, for example, on Audit Quality Indicators in 2020. A system of quality management operates in a continual and iterative manner and is responsive to changes in the nature and circumstances of the firm and its engagements. It also does not operate in a linear manner. ISQM (UK) 1 (effective for the audit of periods beginning on or after 15 December 2022) introduces a new approach to quality management at the firm level that emphasises the responsibility of firm leadership for proactively managing quality, while at the same time being scalable to deal with differences in the size of firms and nature of the services they provide.

Under ISQM (UK) 1 and 2, such a risk assessment becomes a requirement and firms will need to consider a more integrated approach and a tailored system of quality management that is suitable to the particular firm and the services that it provides. We look forward to seeing the improvements in audit quality as a result of firms establishing quality objectives, identifying and assessing quality risks and implementing responses to those quality risks. Firms will already have considered aspects of this in their processes over acceptance and continuance and the relevant ethical requirements. We anticipate that the sooner a firm implements this formal quality-driven approach, the sooner quality improvements
