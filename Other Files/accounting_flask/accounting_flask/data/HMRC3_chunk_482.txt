you have g ross payment status (/what-you-must-do-as-a-cis-subcontractor/gross- payment-status), declare all your income in your Corporation Tax return (/prepare- file-annual-accounts-for-limited-company/prepare-a-company-tax-return) as usual.

If your company�s PAYE bill for the period is reduced to zero and you still have some CIS deductions you have not been able to claim back, carry these forward to the next month or quarter (in the same tax year).

If you do not do this by the deadline they give you, HMRC will correct your claim and you will not be able to make any more claims in that tax year. You can appeal HMRC�s decision.
