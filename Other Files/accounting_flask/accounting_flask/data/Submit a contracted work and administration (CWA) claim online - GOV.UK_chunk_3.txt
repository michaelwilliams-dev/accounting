You must check that you’ve used the generic Home Office Reference Number correctly in all cases, ie, only where the actual HO reference number has NOT yet been issued by the point of billing. *Note: generic refers to the use of the default code A0000000 instead of an HO issued reference number When to submit your claim You should make your submission between the 1st and 20th of the month following the submission period. For example, your March submission containing work completed up to and including 31 March should be made between 1 and 20 April.
