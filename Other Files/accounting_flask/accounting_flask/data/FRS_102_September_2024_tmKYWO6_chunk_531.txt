following, respectively: the European Union (Credit Institutions: Financial Statements) Regulations 2015 74 Similarly, corresponding Irish legal references are not provided for the UK legal references in Appendix C to Section 1A Small Entities. Appendix C to Section 1A sets out the disclosure requirements for small entities in the UK, based on the requirements of company law in the UK, while Appendix D to Section 1A sets out the disclosure requirements for small entities in the Republic of Ireland, based on the requirements of company law in the Republic of Ireland. (SI No. 266 of 2015) (Credit Institutions Regulations 2015); and the European Union (Insurance Undertakings: Financial Statements) Regulations 2015 (SI No. 262 of 2015) (Insurance Undertakings Regulations 2015). Similar to the approach noted in paragraph A3.3 of Appendix III of this FRS, where reference is made in this appendix to Schedule 3 to the Companies Act 2014, Irish entities applying the Credit Institutions Regulations 2015, the Insurance Undertakings Regulations 2015 or Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 2014 should read the references as referring to the corresponding paragraphs in those regulations or that Schedule where applicable. Small entities applying the small companies regime should read them as referring to the corresponding paragraph in Schedule 3A (Accounting principles, form and content of entity financial statements of a company qualifying for the small companies regime) or Schedule 4A (Accounting principles, form and content of group financial statements for companies subject to the small companies regime) to the Companies Act 2014, where applicable. The requirements of Schedule 3 to the Companies Act 2014 are not necessarily the same as those contained in the Credit Institutions Regulations 2015 or in the Insurance Undertakings Regulations 2015 in all cases. References should be made to the specific requirement as appropriate. Note: Schedule 6 to the Regulations
