to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, there were differences of opinion over how the previous requirements of FRS 105 should be applied to forgiven payments in operating lease agreements. If this had led to different accounting treatments for changes in lease payments that had arisen under similar circumstances it would have been unhelpful to users of financial statements. Although concerns about the treatment of forgiven lease payments were raised predominantly from the perspective of lessees, because of the similarities between the relevant recognition requirements of FRS 105, the accounting by both lessees and lessors was addressed. The amendments were intended to reflect the particular circumstances that had resulted in these changes in lease payments occurring, where there had typically been a temporary reduction in the lesseeâ€™s benefit from the use of the leased asset. Requiring entities to recognise the impact of changes in lease payments over the periods that the change is intended to compensate was considered to generally reflect the economic substance of the intended benefit of these concessions and their temporary nature, and provide more relevant information for users. The requirements were based on the recognition requirements in Section 19 Government Grants. The criteria for applying the requirements were intended to restrict the treatment to those concessions when it was generally considered to be reflective of the substance of the concession. This minimises the risk of the requirements being applied when it may be more appropriate to recognise changes in lease payments on another basis. The requirements apply only to rent concessions that occur as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and: result in revised consideration for the lease that is less than the consideration for the lease immediately preceding the change. Deferred lease payments do not change the consideration for the lease but change only the timing
