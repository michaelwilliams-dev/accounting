Addressing Exceptions in the use of Audit Data Analytics August 2021 Addressing Exceptions in the use of Audit Data Analytics Introduction & Purpose of this Guidance Technology, and its use in audit, is increasingly at the forefront of discussions between regulators, standard setters, and audit practitioners. Audit firms and third-party providers have committed significant financial and human resource to developing and deploying technology in audits, leading to a significant increase in its usage. In our recent publication, Technological Resources: Using Technology To Enhance Audit Quality, respondents highlighted that many auditors face challenges with the large number of outliers generated when using Audit Data Analytics1 (ADA). Most however agreed that the cause of this was most often an initial inappropriate scoping of the tool, and that with a proper understanding of the parameters, exceptions generated are not unmanageable. In the same publication we committed to developing, with the assistance of the newly reformed Audit Technical Advisory Group (TAG), guidance for auditors to aid in dealing with the sometimes-large volume of outliers generated when using ADA, highlighting best practice and key documentation considerations. We have developed this guidance taking account of real-world examples observed both by our own Audit Quality Review (AQR) team and described to us by auditors through the FRCâ€™s External Technology Working Group. This approach has enabled us produce guidance that it is reflective of current practice and is based on real-world principles. In this guidance, we have laid out general principles for dealing with outliers when using ADA to respond to identified risks in an audit, a potential approach auditors could take and included an illustrative example based on a real-world scenario. We have also included best practice, and potential pitfalls to avoid, when refining expectations developed for ADA to assist auditors in undertaking this process effectively. Additionally,
