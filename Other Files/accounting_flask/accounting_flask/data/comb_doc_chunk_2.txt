of a type covered by 2.4D, over which such an individual holds a Power of Attorney, are prohibited. This is because such interests are held through an intermediary (the ‘living estate’ of the individual whose Power of Attorney they hold) which they control. Where the individual is a potential beneficiary of that estate (for example, under a will) any financial interest in which they have a beneficial interest could be either a direct financial interest, if the estate has an ownership or direct beneficial interest, or an indirect financial interest, if the estate holds a beneficial interest through an intermediary over which the estate does not have control or significant influence. As a result, audit firms need to ensure that they place a requirement on their staff to notify the firm of any powers of attorney they (or persons closely associated to them) hold, and the point at which they come into force, so that the audit firm can take necessary action, or provide staff members with appropriate advice to avoid a power of attorney resulting in a breach of the Ethical Standard. In putting into place appropriate policies, audit firms need to consider that the independence of the holder of a Power of Attorney which has not yet been activated, may still pose a risk of a breach because that individual may be perceived to have a growing ability to influence the way in which the assets held under a Power of Attorney are invested. Where the individual holding the Power of Attorney has no beneficial interest in the assets of the estate, the requirements of ES 2.18-2.20 relating to financial interests held in a trustee capacity should be considered because we believe there is a strong analogy between acting as a trustee and holding a Power of Attorney.
