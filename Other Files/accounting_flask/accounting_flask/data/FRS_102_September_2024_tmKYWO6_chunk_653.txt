reliably and shall therefore not be recognised. This is a pragmatic solution recognising that there are potential issues in determining a value for volunteer services and their contribution to the organisation and notes that quantifying this type of service may not be practicable. There is an argument to suggest that volunteer services could be measured by reference to a metric such as the minimum wage, however this measure does not take into consideration an organisation’s requirements for volunteers. In addition, this would be attributing an arbitrary value to a volunteer’s time which may not be reflective of their skills, experience or role and to determine a different method of valuation would be very subjective. B34I.6 However, when a service is provided voluntarily and its value can be measured reliably, for example a service for which the entity would otherwise have had to pay (eg legal or financial advice), the value to the entity of that service should be recognised in the financial statements. B34I.7 As part of the Periodic Review 2024, amendments were made to incorporate the requirements of extant Appendix B Guidance on incoming resources from non-exchange transactions (paragraphs PBE34.64 to PBE34.74) into paragraphs PBE34.64 to PBE34.74 and to delete that appendix. These changes were not intended to alter practice, but to make the standard easier to apply. B34I.8 The amendments included a clear articulation of whether and when incoming resources from non-exchange transactions shall be recognised and, if so, measured either at the fair value of the resources received or receivable, or the value to the entity. The determination of the value to the entity, which takes into account what the entity would have done had the resources not been donated, was also clarified. B34I.9 The guidance on legacies was also clarified to focus on the principle that
