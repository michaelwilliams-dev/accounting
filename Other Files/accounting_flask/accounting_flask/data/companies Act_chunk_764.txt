of capital. The court shall settle a list of creditors entitled to object. For that purpose the court— shall ascertain, as far as possible without requiring an application from any creditor, the names of those creditors and the nature and amount of their debts or claims, and may publish notices fixing a day or days within which creditors not entered on the list are to claim to be so entered or are to be excluded from the right of objecting to the reduction of capital. If a creditor entered on the list whose debt or claim is not discharged or has not determined does not consent to the reduction, the court may, if it thinks fit, dispense with the consent of that creditor on the company securing payment of his debt or claim. For this purpose the debt or claim must be secured by appropriating (as the court may direct) the following amount— if the company admits the full amount of the debt or claim or, though not admitting it, is willing to provide for it, the full amount of the debt or claim; if the company does not admit, and is not willing to provide for, the full amount of the debt or claim, or if the amount is contingent or not ascertained, an amount fixed by the court after the like enquiry and adjudication as if the company were being wound up by the court. Offences in connection with list of creditors If an officer of the company— intentionally or recklessly— conceals the name of a creditor entitled to object to the reduction of capital, or misrepresents the nature or amount of the debt or claim of a creditor, or is knowingly concerned in any such concealment or misrepresentation, he commits an offence.
