STAFF GUIDANCE NOTE 05/2016 (Revised) Prohibited Tax Services The Audit Regulation prohibits the provision of certain tax services to public interest entities, which are set out in the Ethical Standard ES 5.167R (services relating to: the preparation of tax forms; payroll tax; customs duties; identification of public subsidies and tax incentives unless required of the auditor by law; support for tax inspections unless required of the auditor by law; calculation of direct, indirect or deferred tax; and the provision of tax advice). Certain of these services may still be provided subject to the derogation at ES 5.168R which applies where those services: (i) do not have a direct effect on the financial statements1; (ii) have an indirect effect on the financial statements but that effect would be inconsequential in the view of an objective, reasonable and informed third party; and (iii) are not used to provide assurance for the purposes of the statutory audit. The FRC has been asked whether it would be appropriate to provide information on tax services which are permitted. However, we consulted before the Audit Regulation and Directive came into force, on the principle that the FRC Ethical Standard should focus on setting out clearly those services which are prohibited, which was widely supported by stakeholders. It would not, therefore, be appropriate to provide for guidance purposes a list of permitted services. We do, however, agree that it may be helpful to provide more guidance to practitioners on examples of those services that we consider are likely to be subject to the prohibition. The Ethical Standard lists seven tax services that the auditor of a public-interest entity may not provide, subject to the derogation. In all cases, the examples provided are indicative and not exhaustive. The fact that a particular service or activity is not listed
