B29.9 The requirement to disclose differences between the current tax charge and a standard rate of tax for the next three years, was replaced by a requirement to disclose expected net reversals of timing differences for the next year.

The additional benefit of disclosure on a net basis outweighs the cost to preparers of forecasting future new timing differences.
