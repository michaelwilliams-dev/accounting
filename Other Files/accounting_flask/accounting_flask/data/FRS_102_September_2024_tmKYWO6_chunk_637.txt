most cases. B29.3 The most significant change to the requirements in previous accounting standards is that the ‘timing differences plus’ approach requires the recognition of the deferred tax implications of the revaluation of assets. Gains and losses recognised on a revaluation are timing differences and the tax effects should be recognised. Such a requirement is consistent with IAS 12 and the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. B29.4 Another significant change from previous accounting standards is that discounting of current and deferred tax is not allowed which is consistent with IAS 12 and the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. B29.5 Under IAS 12 deferred tax is not generally recognised on the initial recognition of an asset, except that of assets and liabilities arising from a business combination. No specific exception for this is necessary under the ‘timing differences plus’ approach as no timing difference arises. B29.6 IAS 12 requires that deferred tax is recognised in respect of the difference between the amount recognised on a business combination for assets and liabilities (other than goodwill) and the amount that will be allowed for or assessed to tax in respect of such assets and liabilities. These differences are not timing differences. In order to maintain consistency with IAS 12, the timing differences approach is supplemented with a requirement to recognise deferred tax on business combinations. B29.7 FRS 102 does not permit the recognition of deferred tax: when the tax deduction (or estimated future deduction) for share-based payment exceeds the cumulative amount of the related remuneration expense; and in some cases, when the tax basis of an asset is changed, for example when legislation changes the amount of future tax relief relating to the asset. B29.8 However, it is considered that differences with IAS 12 are likely to be relatively rare and that in
