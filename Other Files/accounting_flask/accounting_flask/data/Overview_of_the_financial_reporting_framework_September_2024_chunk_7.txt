Ireland can be found in Appendix B to Section 6 Notes to the Financial Statements of FRS 105. Financial commitments, guarantees and contingencies not included in the balance sheet, including any valuable security given in respect of these. However, micro-entities may voluntarily choose to disclose more information. Micro-entities' accounts that comply with the minimal legal requirements are presumed in law to give a true and fair view. Therefore, there is no requirement for directors to consider what additional information may be needed in order for the accounts to give a true and fair view. In addition to these legal constraints, FRS 105 is simplified further, for example: deferred tax and equity-settled share-based payments shall not be recognised; and all accounting policy choices have been removed, including the options to capitalise development costs and borrowing costs. More detailed discussion of the additional simplifications can be found in FRS 105. Appendix I to this document sets out the key features of FRS 105. The small entities regime (Section 1A Small Entities of FRS 102) Similarly to FRS 105, Section 1A Small Entities of FRS 102 has been developed around the legal framework and from the requirements of FRS 102 for this group of entities. The requirements of the small entities regime are more comprehensive than those of the micro-entities regime and the recognition and measurement requirements of Section 1A are generally the same as those set out in the rest of FRS 102. In relation to recognition and measurement, key differences between the small entities regime and the micro-entities regime include the use of fair value and revaluation accounting, the recognition of significant operating leases on-balance sheet, and the additional accounting requirements in respect of derivatives, deferred tax and equity-settled share-based payments. Directors of small entities are legally obligated to prepare accounts
