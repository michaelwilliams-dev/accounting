acquisition is treated as a transaction between equity holders. As with FRS 2, the non-controlling interest’s share in the net assets of Company B will decrease by CU10m ((30% – 20%) x CU100m) and will now total CU20m (CU30m - CU10m). Company B’s net assets are not revalued and will remain at CU100m. No additional goodwill is recognised. Disposal of subsidiaries Where control is lost This scenario arises where either a parent disposes of all of its shares in its subsidiary, or a parent disposes of some of its shares such that it no longer has a controlling holding (for example from 80% down to 40%). There is no difference in the accounting treatment between current UK accounting standards and FRS 102. The results of the subsidiary (ie its profit or loss) will be included in the consolidation up to the date of disposal, and a gain or loss on disposal should also be recognised. This gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the consideration received and the proportion of the identifiable net assets (including goodwill) of the subsidiary disposed of. Where control is retained This scenario arises where a parent disposes of some of its shares such that it still has a controlling holding (for example from 80% down to 60%). FRS 2 Accounting for subsidiary undertakings|FRS 102| Where a group reduces its interest in a subsidiary undertaking, it should record any proﬁt or loss arising calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the net assets of that subsidiary undertaking attributable to the group’s interest before the reduction and the carrying amount attributable to the group’s interest after the reduction together with any proceeds received. The net assets compared should include any related goodwill not previously written off through the proﬁt
