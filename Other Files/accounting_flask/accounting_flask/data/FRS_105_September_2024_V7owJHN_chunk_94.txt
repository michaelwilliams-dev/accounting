transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that it will be entitled to the cumulative amount of revenue recognised when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. At the end of each reporting period, a micro-entity shall update the estimate of the variable amount included in the transaction price to reflect any relevant changes in circumstances. A micro-entity shall allocate any changes in the estimate of the variable amount to the performance obligations in the contract on the same basis as at contract inception (see paragraph 18.33). Amounts allocated to a performance obligation that has been satisfied shall be recognised as revenue, or a reduction in revenue, in the period in which the estimate changes.

Any excess of the deferred payment amount over the cash price available on the transaction date is recognised as interest and accounted for in accordance with paragraph 9.14(a). Step 4 â€“ Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract A micro-entity shall allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract on a relative stand-alone selling price basis in accordance with paragraphs 18.28 to 18.30, unless allocating discounts or variable amounts on an alternative basis in accordance with paragraphs 18.31 to 18.33. Paragraphs 18.28 to 18.33 do not apply if: a contract contains a single performance obligation; or all performance obligations in a contract are satisfied at the same point in time in accordance with paragraph 18.39. Allocation based on stand-alone selling prices A micro-entity shall determine the stand-alone
