plus a fixed interest rate of 1% therefore meets the condition in paragraph 11.9(a)(iv).| 3A|A loan with interest payable at the bank’s standard variable rate plus 1% throughout the life of the loan – the bank’s standard variable rate is negative As discussed in Example 3, the combination of a positive bank’s standard variable rate plus a fixed interest rate of 1% meets the condition in paragraph 11.9(a)(iv). However, the conditions in paragraph 11.9(a) do not explicitly address the case when the bank’s standard variable rate is negative and such a rate may not meet the conditions. The interest rate is consistent with the description in paragraph 11.9A provided the bank’s standard variable rate reflects prevailing economic conditions and monetary policies. In this case the negative interest rate represents reasonable compensation for basic lending risks.| 4|A loan with interest payable at the bank’s standard variable rate less 1% throughout the life of the loan, with the condition that the interest rate can never fall below 2% Paragraph 11.9(aB)(i)(1) permits variation of a return to a holder (lender) that is contingent on a change of a contractual variable rate. In this example the contractual variable rate is the bank’s standard variable rate. The variation of the return to the holder is between the bank’s standard variable rate less 1% and 2%, depending on the bank’s standard variable rate. For example, if the bank’s standard variable rate is less than 3%, the return to the holder is fixed at 2%; if the bank’s standard variable rate is higher than 3%, the return to the holder is the bank’s standard variable rate less 1%. The contractual variation meets the condition in paragraph 11.9(aB)(i)(1). The holder is protected against the risk of losing the principal amount of the loan via the interest rate floor
