recognising a plan surplus (see paragraph 28.41(l)). The FRC considered that such disclosure would provide useful information to users of financial statements, in the context of changing economic conditions which mean that more defined benefit pension schemes have been reporting a surplus. This disclosure requirement is in addition to any disclosure about judgements or key sources of estimation uncertainty made in accordance with paragraphs 8.6 or 8.7.

Respondents agreed that the IFRS for SMEs Standard (2009) requirements should not be retained but also did not support the proposal to replace it with IAS 12. B29.2 In developing an alternative solution, the findings of the ASB’s research work with EFRAG in developing the Discussion Paper Improving the Financial Reporting of Income Tax (issued in December 2011), as well as the FRC’s commitment to an IFRS-based solution and the requirements of FRS 19 Deferred Tax from which entities would be transitioning, were considered. The proposal set out an alternative approach that based the recognition requirements on timing differences, with additional recognition requirements for certain temporary differences that are not timing differences; a ‘timing differences plus’ approach. The advantages of this approach were that it would: provide useful information to users of financial statements; and provide the simple solution preparers were looking for that was close to previous accounting standards and that would give the same answers as IFRS in
