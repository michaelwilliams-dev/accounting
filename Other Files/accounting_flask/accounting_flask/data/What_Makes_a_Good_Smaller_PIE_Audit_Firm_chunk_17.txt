RSB and who is the person authorised by the firm to be the main FRC contact for registration purposes. The PAC will be provided with access to the FRC’s Registration Sharepoint site for the purpose of uploading the completed application documents as set out below. You will need to complete: A short application form in MS Forms format. A spreadsheet of RIs that the firm wishes to register. We expect firms to seek to register only those RIs that currently, or are scheduled to, act on PIE audits (additional RIs may be added after the firm becomes registered if circumstances change). Each RI must complete an MS Forms RI application and supply details of their experience as well as the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) they have completed and plan to complete. A spreadsheet showing all the firm’s current and potential PIE audits (so far as known at the time) over the next 24 months and the RI that will be allocated to each audit. A supporting statement to explain in further detail how the firm meets the Registration Requirements in section 4 of the Regulations including: The competence and experience of the firm in relation to PIE audits; details of fit and proper procedures in place. The process to ensure that all staff involved in PIE audits are aware of the Regulations. Details of how the firm ensures that it has sufficient financial and non- financial resources to enable it to undertake PIE audits; how the firm complies with ISQM 1. Details of the firm’s governance arrangements to ensure that it is suitable to operate a firm undertaking PIE audits. Firms must ensure that they provide sufficent information in their supporting statement (not merely affirming that they meet the requirements). The Registration team will request further details if insufficient information
