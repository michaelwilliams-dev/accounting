relationship solely due to changes required by interest rate benchmark reform and the entity would not have been required to discontinue that hedging relationship if paragraphs 12.25J to 12.25U had been applied at that time; and at the beginning of the reporting period in which an entity first applies paragraphs 12.25J to 12.25U (the date of first-time application), that discontinued hedging relationship meets the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting in this FRS (after taking into account paragraphs 12.25J to 12.25U). If, in applying paragraph 1.27, an entity reinstates a discontinued hedging relationship, the entity shall read references in paragraphs 12.25T and 12.25U to the date the alternative benchmark rate is identified as a non-contractually specified risk component for the first time, as referring to the date of first-time application of paragraphs 12.25T and 12.25U (ie the 24-month period for that alternative benchmark rate designated as a non-contractually specified risk component begins from the date of first-time application of these paragraphs). An entity is not required to restate prior periods when applying the amendments in paragraph 1.25 retrospectively. If an entity does not restate prior periods, the entity shall apply those amendments in remeasuring the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as at the beginning of the reporting period in which the amendments are first applied and shall make a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of each affected component of equity. On the first-time application of the requirements in paragraph 12.25J, and only then, instead of applying paragraph 12.25M, an entity shall amend the hedge documentation as required in paragraph 12.25J no later than the date the respective financial statements are authorised for issue. In the reporting period in which an entity first applies these amendments, and in relation to these amendments only, an entity is not required to disclose
