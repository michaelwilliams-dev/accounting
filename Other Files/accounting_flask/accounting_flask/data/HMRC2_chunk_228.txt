period that qualifies for this pool. Only include VAT if you�re not VAT registered. Deduct the value of anything you sold or �disposed of� that originally qualified for this pool. Work out how much you can claim using the correct rate for that pool. Deduct the amount you can claim from the pool to get the closing balance. This is known as the �tax written down value�. Use the amount left in each pool as the opening balance for the next accounting period. Example The opening balance in your main pool is �9,000. You buy a machine worth �1,200. The total for this pool is then �10,200 (�9,000 plus �1,200). You sell a desk for �200. The total for this pool is then �10,000 (�10,200 minus �200). Apply the rate for the main pool (18%). The amount you can claim for this pool in this period is �1,800 (18% of �10,000). The rest (�8,200) is your closing balance or tax written down value. This is carried over and becomes your opening balance in this pool for your next accounting period. Items you use outside your business For items that are in a single asset pool because you�ve used them outside your business, reduce the amount you can claim by the amount you use them privately. You still deduct the full amount from your pool to get the closing balance. Example You have a single asset pool for a car that qualifies for the main rate (18%). The opening balance is �10,000. You use the car for your family for half the time. If you did not use it outside your business, you could�ve claimed �1,800 (18% of �10,000) for the car. Because you use it for your family half the time, you can only claim �900 (half of �1,800). You
