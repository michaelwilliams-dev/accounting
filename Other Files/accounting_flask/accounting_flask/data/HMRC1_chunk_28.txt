What you get If you give these to charity (including selling them for less than they�re worth): you won�t have to pay tax on capital gains (/tax-when-your-company-sells-assets) you can deduct the value of the gift (its �market value�) from your business profits before you pay tax (/tax-limited-company-g ives-to-charity/how-to-claim) If you donate or sell to a community amateur sports club (/government/publications/community-amateur-sports-clubs-casc-registered-with- hmrc--2) (CASC), you don�t pay tax on capital gains but you can�t deduct the value of the gift from your business profits. Work out the market value You�ll need to know how much the gift would sell for in an open market (its �market value�) to calculate your tax relief. (/calculate-the-value-of-your-donation-to- charity) You can get professional help (/tax-help) with this. What you need to do You must keep documents relating to the donation to show that you�ve made the gift or sale and that the charity has accepted it. You must keep these records for at least 6 years. Land or property You must get a letter or certificate from the charity which contains: a description of the land or property the date of the gift or sale (the �disposal date�) a statement confirming that it now owns the land or property Shares You must fill in a stock transfer form to take the shares out of your company�s name and put them into the charity�s name. Selling land, property or shares on behalf of a charity When you offer a gift of land, property or shares, the charity may ask you to sell the gift on its behalf. You can do this and still claim tax relief (/tax-limited-company-g ives-to-charity/how-to- claim) for the donation, but you must keep records of the gift and the charity�s request. Without them, you might have to pay Corporation Tax (/tax-when-your- company-sells-assets). 5. Seconding employees
