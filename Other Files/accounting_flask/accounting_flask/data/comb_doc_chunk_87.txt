reflect the difference between the depreciation based on the revalued amount and depreciation based on the original cost. Presentation in reserves Company law requires the revaluation reserve to be shown separately in the statement of financial position. Key FRS 102 references 17.15 17.15 17.15B 17.15B 17.15E Transfer from investment property to property, plant and equipment An entity may have investment property that subsequently become owner-occupied. When a property ceases to meet the definition of an investment property the deemed cost for subsequent accounting as property, plant and equipment shall be its fair value at the date of change in use. Example Entity A has an office building that was rented out to an unrelated party. Its fair value at 31 December 2017 was CU300,000 and on 1 January 2018 it became owner-occupied. The cumulative fair value gains to 31 December 2017 were £100,000. Its fair value at 1 January 2018 becomes its deemed cost and the basis for future depreciation charges. Although the value of the property has not changed, accounting entries will be required to move the cumulative fair value gains from retained profits to a revaluation reserve because the property is now measured under the alternative accounting rules of Schedule 1 to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/410) (the Regulations). The change in reserves is recognised as follows: Dr Profit and loss account (retained profits) CU100,000 Cr Revaluation reserve CU100,000 Company law and FRS 102 disclosure requirements for revalued properties will apply to the property on an ongoing basis, including the need to disclose comparable amounts determined according to the historical cost accounting rules (in this case cost of £200,000). This example assumes that Entity A measures owner-occupied property under the cost model. If Entity A uses the revaluation model
