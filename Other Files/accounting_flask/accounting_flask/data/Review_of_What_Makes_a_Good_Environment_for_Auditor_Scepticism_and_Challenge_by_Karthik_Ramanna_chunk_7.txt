Importantly, what this means is that for every audit firm that does succeed in building an effective culture of challenge, there are enormous profits to be earned, as their challenge culture cannot be easily replicated. But even as some firms have enjoyed success in sustaining a culture of challenge, there are opportunities for improvement.
