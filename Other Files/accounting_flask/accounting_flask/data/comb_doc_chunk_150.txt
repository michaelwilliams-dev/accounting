further detail of components of employee costs, but the following is relevant: Accruals are liabilities to pay for goods or services that have been received or supplied but have not been paidâ€¦ including amounts due to employees (for example amounts relating to accrued holiday pay). (FRS 12 paragraph 11(b))|Short-term employee benefits include items such as the following, if expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the related service: wages, salaries and social security contributions; paid annual leave and paid sick leave; profit-sharing and bonuses; and non-monetary benefits (such as medical care, housing, cars and free or subsidised goods or services) for current employees. (FRS 102 paragraph 28.4)| Measurement Current UK accounting standards|FRS 102| No explicit requirements, but employee costs would be measured at transaction amount.|When an employee has rendered service to an entity during the reporting periods, the entity shall measure the amounts at the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service. (FRS 102 paragraph 28.5) An entity shall recognise the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences when the employees render service that increases their entitlement to future compensated absences, at the undiscounted additional amount that the entity expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end of the reporting period. The entity shall present this amount as falling due within one year at the reporting date. (FRS 102 paragraph 28.6) An entity shall recognise the cost of other (non-accumulating) compensated absences when the absences occur, at the undiscounted amount of salaries and wages paid or payable for the period of absence. (FRS 102 paragraph 28.7)| Current UK GAAP is much less explicit about the accounting for short-term benefits than FRS
