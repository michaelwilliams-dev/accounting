Penalties for failing to file accounts Failure to deliver accounts on time is a criminal offence. In addition, the law imposes a civil penalty for late filing of accounts on the company. The amount of the penalty depends on how late the accounts arrive and whether the company is private or public at the date of the balance sheet: Length of period Private company Public company Not more than 1 month �150 �750 More than 1 month but not more than 3 months �375 �1,500 More than 3 months but not more than 6 months �750 �3,000 More than 6 months �1,500 �7,500 See our guidance on late filing penalties (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/late-filing-penalties). 6.1 If you do not submit accounts to Companies House If the registrar believes that a company is no longer carrying on business or in operation, it could be struck off the register and dissolved. If this happens, all the assets of the company (including its bank account and property) could become the property of the Crown. Failing to deliver documents is a criminal offence - and all directors of the company risk prosecution. If convicted, a director could end up with a criminal record and a potentially unlimited fine for each offence. This is separate from any late filing penalty imposed on the company. 7.
