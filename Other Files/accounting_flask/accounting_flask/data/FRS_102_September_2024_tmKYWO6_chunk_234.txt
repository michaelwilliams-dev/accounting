property transfer taxes and other transaction costs. If payment is deferred beyond normal credit terms, the cost is the present value of all future payments. An entity shall determine the cost of a self-constructed investment property in accordance with paragraphs 17.10 to 17.14. An investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset shall be measured initially at its cost in accordance with Section 20. Subsequent measurement An investment property shall be measured at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. When a lessee uses the fair value model to measure an investment property that is held as a right-of-use asset, it shall measure the right-of-use asset, and not the underlying property, at fair value. Section 2A provides guidance on determining fair value. Transfers [Deleted] Unless otherwise required by this FRS, an entity shall transfer a property to, or from, investment property only when the property meets, or ceases to meet, the definition of investment property and there is evidence of that change. 16.9A When a property ceases to meet the definition of an investment property (for example it becomes owner-occupied or inventory), the deemed cost for subsequent accounting as property, plant and equipment (in accordance with Section 17), a right-of-use asset (in accordance with Section 20), or inventory (in accordance with Section 13 Inventories) shall be its fair value at the date of change in use. 16.9B If an owner-occupied property becomes an investment property, an entity shall apply Section 17 (for owned property) or Section 20 (for property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset) up to the date of change in use. The entity shall treat any difference at that date between the carrying amount of the property in accordance with Section 17 or Section 20
