different on application of FRS 102 (unless entities choose to transfer gains and losses on remeasurement of investment property to a separate reserve, in which case the balance sheet may appear unchanged). Amounts that would previously have been shown in a revaluation reserve will be part of the accumulated profit and loss account. An entity choosing not to show a separate revaluation reserve may wish to make disclosure regarding distributable and non-distributable profits. As set out in the ICAEW Technical Release 02/10 Guidance On The Determination Of Realised Profits And Losses In The Context Of Distributions Under The Companies Act 2006, the revaluation of an investment property is not considered realised as the fair value of the investment property is not readily convertible to cash. Transfers to and from investment properties SSAP 19|FRS 102| Not specifically addressed.|Provides that transfers to, or from, investment property shall only occur when the property first meets, or ceases to meet, the definition of investment property. (FRS 102 paragraph 16.9) A transfer is also made where a reliable measure of fair value is no longer available without undue cost or effort for an item of investment property measured using the fair value model. (FRS 102 paragraph 16.8)| Application is unlikely to change as fair values can normally be obtained without undue cost or effort.
