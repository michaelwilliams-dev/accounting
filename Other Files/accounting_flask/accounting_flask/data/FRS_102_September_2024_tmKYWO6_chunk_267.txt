Merger accounting method With the merger accounting method the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of the parties to the combination are not required to be adjusted to fair value, although appropriate adjustments shall be made to achieve uniformity of accounting policies in the combining entities. Subject to the requirements of paragraphs 9.9 and 9.9A, the results and cash flows of all the combining entities shall be brought into the financial statements of the combined entity from the beginning of the financial year in which the combination occurred, adjusted so as to achieve uniformity of accounting policies. The comparative information shall be restated by including, for all the combining entities, the total comprehensive income for the previous reporting period and their statements of financial position for the previous reporting date, adjusted as necessary to achieve uniformity of accounting policies. The difference, if any, between the nominal value of the shares issued plus the fair value of any other consideration given, and the nominal value of the shares received in exchange shall be shown as a movement on other reserves in the consolidated financial statements. Any existing balances on the share premium account or capital redemption reserve of the new subsidiary shall be brought in by being shown as a movement on other reserves. These movements shall be shown in the statement of changes in equity. Merger expenses are not to be included as part of this adjustment, but shall be charged to the statement of comprehensive income as part of profit or loss
