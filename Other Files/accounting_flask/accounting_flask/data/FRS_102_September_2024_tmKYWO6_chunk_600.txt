may discontinue hedge accounting voluntarily. This is a departure from IFRS 9. The FRC considered the restrictions in IFRS 9 on discontinuation unnecessarily onerous, and instead retained the existing option of voluntary discontinuation. An entity must document the election to discontinue hedge accounting, which is consistent with the requirement for documentation at the start of hedge accounting.

Some respondents were concerned that this flexibility may be abused, as it allows entities to apply a degree of hindsight. The FRC was mindful of this possible exploitation of the transitional arrangements, nevertheless, on balance it believed that in the interests of the majority of entities, especially entities that have not applied hedge accounting before, flexibility should take precedence over restrictions aimed at preventing abuse.
