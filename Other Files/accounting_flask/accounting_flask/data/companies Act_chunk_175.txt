The person may not act as a director of the company until notice is given under section 167G. A person who contravenes subsection (2) commits an offence. Where the offence is committed by a firm, every officer of the firm who is in default also commits the offence. It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to prove that they reasonably believed that notice had been given under section 167G. A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on summary conviction— in England and Wales, to a fine; in Scotland or Northern Ireland, to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale and, for continued contravention, a daily default fine not exceeding one- tenth of level 5 on the standard scale. The only consequence of a contravention of subsection (2) is the offence provided for by this section (so that, for example, a contravention does not in any way affect the validity of a person’s acts as a director).] Part 10 – A company's directors Chapter 1 – Appointment and removal of directors Document Generated: 2025-03-12 Status: This version of this Act contains provisions that are prospective.
