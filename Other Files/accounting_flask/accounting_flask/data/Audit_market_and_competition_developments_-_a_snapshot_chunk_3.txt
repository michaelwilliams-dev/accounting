do not. There would be enough opportunities to compete, and there would be sufficient choice of viable competitors (audit firms) over the long term, without undue barriers to entry and expansion. Within firms, individual auditors’ personal success would depend on whether they deliver high-quality audits, and audit practices as a whole would be focused on the success of audit. Regulation would provide an external check on quality, setting standards, increasing transparency and addressing sub-standard performance both by firms and by individuals. This would support competition on quality because buyers (Audit Committees) would have better information on which to choose their auditor. As we set out in our competition policy paper, the FRC cannot achieve this well-functioning audit market by itself or simply by implementing a single measure. This will require a range of actions and activities involving many organisations and individuals, and it will take time. 1 For more details of our objectives, see FRC three year plan 2023-6 (March 2023) 2 For the FRC’s definition of a high quality audit, see What Makes a Good Audit (November 2021), p.6 3 A resilient audit market would include sufficient choice of audit firms and firms that are financially sound and focused on quality. Recent developments in the audit market In this section, we provide the latest available information for the key indicators relating to audit market dynamics and competition reported in the competition policy paper. We show any changes in these indicators for the FTSE 350 and wider PIE audit markets between 2021 and 2022, and the longer-term trends, where data is available. This is a brief snapshot of the audit market, other FRC publications provide more detailed information on recent developments. For example, our annual Audit Quality Inspection and Supervision reports give information on audit quality at audit firms. Our
