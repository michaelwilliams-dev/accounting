level. IG2.13 The provision for claims handling expenses should be included within the provision for claims outstanding but need not be separately disclosed. Claims handling expenses incurred should be included within claims incurred in the technical account for general business. Discounting Paragraphs IG2.14 to IG2.20 provide guidance for applying the requirements of paragraph 54 of Schedule 3 to the Regulations. They are only relevant to general insurance business. IG2.14 Paragraph 54 of Schedule 3 to the Regulations permits explicit discounting subject to certain conditions, one of which is that the expected average interval between the date for the settlement of claims being discounted and the reporting date must be at least four years. The four-year test should be applied by reference to the end of each reporting period in respect of all claims outstanding at that date, and not just once in the accounting period in which the claims were incurred. IG2.15 Where applied, explicit discounting should normally be adopted by reference to categories of claims (with similar characteristics but not solely by length of settlement pattern), rather than to individual claims. IG2.16 The calculation of the average interval referred to in paragraph IG2.14 should be weighted on the basis of expected claims before any deduction for reinsurance. IG2.17 Discounting should be considered only if there is adequate data available to construct a reliable model of the rate of claims settlement. The principal factors to be considered are the amount of future claims settlements, the timing of future cash flows and the discount rate. Procedures should be undertaken to assess the accuracy of the claims settlement pattern predicted by the model in prior periods and the current model should be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect the out-turn and conclusions of analyses in the previous period. Cash flows should be modelled
