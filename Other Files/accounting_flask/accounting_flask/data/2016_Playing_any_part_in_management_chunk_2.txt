avoid giving any approvals on behalf of management during the course of the engagement. Where an audit firm seconds junior staff on a short term basis to an audited client, the requirements of paragraphs 2.39 to 2.44 of the Ethical Standard will also apply. To avoid the risk that the auditor may, or may be seen to be, involved in decision making, and consistent with the IESBA principles and the SEC rules, the engagement partner must always be satisfied that the audited entityâ€™s management makes all judgments and decisions that are the responsibility of management. Audit Firms may wish to make this clear in their engagement letters with audit clients.
