liability. Original issue of shares or other equity instruments A micro-entity shall recognise the issue of shares or other equity instruments as equity when it issues those instruments and another party is obliged to provide cash or other resources to the micro-entity in exchange for the instruments. If the micro-entity receives the cash or other resources before the equity instruments are issued, and the micro-entity cannot be required to repay the cash or other resources received, the micro-entity shall recognise the corresponding increase in equity to the extent of consideration received. To the extent that the equity instruments have been subscribed for but not issued (or called up), and the micro-entity has not yet received the cash or other resources, the micro-entity shall not recognise an increase in equity. A micro-entity shall measure equity instruments, other than when merger relief or group reconstruction relief under sections 611 to 615 of the Act are applied or those accounted for in accordance with paragraph 17.8A, at the fair value of the cash or other resources received or receivable, net of transaction costs. If payment is deferred and the time value of money is material, the initial measurement shall be on a present value basis. A A micro-entity shall not apply paragraph 17.8 to transactions in which a financial liability is extinguished (partially or in full) by the issue of equity instruments if: the creditor is also a direct or indirect shareholder and is acting in its capacity as a direct or indirect existing shareholder; the creditor and the micro-entity are controlled by the same party or parties before and after the transaction and the substance of the transaction includes an equity distribution by, or contribution to, the micro-entity; or the extinguishment is in accordance with the original terms of the financial liability.
