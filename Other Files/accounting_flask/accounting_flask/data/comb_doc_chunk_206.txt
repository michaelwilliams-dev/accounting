– control achieved in stages; Acquisition – increasing a controlling interest in a subsidiary; Disposal – where control is lost; and Disposal – where control is retained. The term ‘non-controlling interest’ is used throughout this Staff Education Note and is interchangeable with the term ‘minority interest’. This Staff Education Note is written to highlight key areas of consideration when transitioning to FRS 102 and is not designed to be exhaustive. Acquisition of subsidiaries Determination of control and acquisition date Although articulated slightly differently, the determination of when control is achieved, and therefore the acquisition date, in most circumstances, is unlikely to be different between current UK standards and FRS 102 in practice. Step acquisitions / Control achieved in stages This scenario arises when an entity obtains control over another entity over a number of transactions. For example, Company A acquires 30% of Company B on 1 January 20X1, and then a further 40% on 1 January 20X2, resulting in a controlling shareholding of 70%. In this scenario, there is no difference in the accounting treatment between current UK accounting standards and FRS 102. The identifiable net assets of Company B are included in the consolidation at the fair values on the date control is achieved (ie 1 January 20X2), rather than at the date of the earlier purchases. Prior to 1 January 20X2 Company B would be accounted for as an associate, assuming that the 30% holding gave Company A significant influence over Company B. Goodwill is also recognised at the date control is achieved and generally is calculated as the difference between: the aggregate fair value of consideration given at each acquisition stage (as determined in accordance with paragraph 19.11 of FRS 102); and the fair value of Company A’s interest in the identifiable net assets of Company B
