of a financial liability, transaction costs not yet recognised in profit or loss (see paragraph 9.15); plus the cumulative interest income or expense recognised in profit or loss to date (see paragraphs 9.13 and 9.14); minus all repayments of principal and all interest payments or receipts to date; minus, in the case of a financial asset, any reduction (directly or through the use of an allowance account) for impairment or uncollectability (see paragraphs 9.16 to 9.19). Allocation of interest income or expense Total interest income or expense is the difference between the initial transaction price and the total amount of the subsequent contractual receipts or payments, excluding transaction costs. A micro-entity shall allocate total interest income or expense over the term of the contract as follows: For transactions where settlement is deferred (see paragraphs 9.6 and 9.6A), total interest income or expense shall be allocated on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. In all other cases, interest income or expense is allocated at a constant rate on the financial asset’s or financial liability’s carrying amount excluding transaction costs not yet recognised in profit or loss (see paragraph 9.12(b)). The applicable rate will normally be the contractual rate of interest and may be a variable or a fixed rate. Transaction costs Transaction costs not immediately recognised in profit or loss in accordance with paragraph 9.7, are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.
