undertake work: that falls within the scheme on the subcontractor’s own property on any agricultural property of which the subcontractor is a tenant For example, a mainstream contractor lays a pipeline across some land and pays the land owner or tenant to fill in the hole after the pipeline has been laid. We will need the details of: the construction work to be done who will be doing the work where the work will be done the cost of the work Small payments We can authorise deemed contractors not to apply the scheme to small contracts for construction operations amounting to less than £1,000, excluding the cost of materials. (This arrangement does not apply to mainstream contractors.) Local education authority maintained schools The scheme should not be operated for payments made for construction operations by the governing body or head teacher of a maintained school on behalf of the local education authority. Charities The scheme should not be operated for payments made for construction operations by any body of persons or trust established for charitable purposes only. However, trading subsidiaries of such charitable bodies or trusts will need to apply the scheme to such payments where appropriate. Generally, that will mean where the trading subsidiaries are brought into the scheme because they have spent over £3 million on construction operations in the previous 12 month period as described at paragraph 2.2 onwards. Under the scheme, the term ‘subcontractor’ has a special meaning that is much wider than it normally has in the construction industry. Subcontractors A subcontractor is a person or body that has agreed to carry out construction operations for a contractor. The subcontractor may be carrying out the operations in any way, including: carrying out the operations themselves having the operations done by their own employees or subcontractors
