tax liability (asset) shall be recognised for the additional tax that will be paid (avoided) in respect of that difference. Similarly, a deferred tax asset (liability) shall be recognised for the additional tax that will be avoided (paid) because of a difference between the value at which a liability is recognised in a business combination accounted for by applying the purchase method and the tax base of that liability. The amount attributed to goodwill (or negative goodwill) shall be adjusted by the amount of deferred tax recognised. A In applying paragraph 29.11 and determining the tax base of an asset or a liability an entity shall consider the manner in which the entity expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of the relevant asset or liability. Measurement of deferred tax An entity shall measure a deferred tax liability (asset) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference. A As an exception to the requirements in this section, an entity shall not take into account the effects of Pillar Two legislation when measuring deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. When different tax rates apply to different levels of taxable profit, an entity shall measure deferred tax expense (income) and related deferred tax liabilities (assets) using the average enacted or substantively enacted rates that it expects to be applicable to the taxable profit (tax loss) of the periods in which it expects the deferred tax asset to be realised or the deferred tax liability to be settled. In some jurisdictions, income taxes are payable at a higher or lower rate if part or all of the profit or retained earnings is paid
