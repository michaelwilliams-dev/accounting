In broad terms, the recent developments in the audit market suggest no significant improvements with competition in the audit market since the CMAâ€™s audit market study in 2018/19. Some FTSE350 companies have switched to hiring non-Big Four firms in recent years but in relatively low numbers; this is not yet a sustained trend. There remains high concentration among four audit firms, resulting in limited choice and ongoing concerns about resilience. Improving competition in the audit market will require a range of actions. The route to increasing choice will require challenger firms to continue developing their capacity and capability to deliver high quality audits, and for these firms to have greater opportunity to deliver more audit work, especially for FTSE 350 companies.

We want to act now to help improve competition and realise all the elements of a well- functioning audit market. We
