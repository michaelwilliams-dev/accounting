This led to the audit team spending time inefficiently early on in the engagement and then requiring extra resource later on. If the manager had recognised the uncertainty surrounding their assessment of when the team would receive information, he could have, for example, enquired with management about their plans and timelines, and better planned the audit accordingly. FRC | Professional Judgement Guidance 11 Commitment to quality In addition to the other aspects of mindset discussed here, it is important that the auditor is committed to making quality judgements, or else the other factors may not be brought to bear in an appropriate way. The motivation behind such a commitment can stem from many sources, including the ethical values required of professional and trainee accountants, an understanding of the public interest role of audit and appropriately aligned incentives from the audit firm. FRC | Professional Judgement Guidance 12 Professional Judgement Trigger and Process This portion of the framework comprises a series of steps which may help to structure the way in which a judgement is carried out and documented, as well as a “trigger” step setting out the importance of staying alert to when professional judgement might be called for, and when a more formal judgement process might be warranted. Although the process is split into discrete “steps” for ease of presentation, that is not meant to imply that judgement is a simple linear process. It may be appropriate at any step to return to any other step in the process, for example if new information comes to light.
