amounts for the remaining years. Sale and leaseback transactions If an entity (the seller-lessee) transfers an asset to another entity (the buyer-lessor) and leases that asset back from the buyer-lessor, both the seller-lessee and the buyer-lessor shall account for the transfer contract and the lease applying paragraphs 20.123 to 20.126. Transfer of the asset is a sale If the transfer of an asset by the seller-lessee satisfies the requirements of Section 23 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset: The seller-lessee shall make an accounting policy choice, which it shall apply consistently, to either: measure the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained by the seller-lessee. Accordingly, the seller-lessee shall recognise only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor; or measure the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback in accordance with paragraph 20.46, with any excess of the sale proceeds over the previous carrying amount of the asset deferred, and amortised over the lease term, and any shortfall of the sales proceeds under the carrying amount recognised immediately in profit or loss. The buyer-lessor shall account for the purchase of the asset applying other sections of this FRS, and for the lease applying the lessor accounting requirements in this section. If the fair value of the consideration for the sale of an asset does not equal the fair value of the asset, or if the payments for the lease are not at market rates, an entity shall make the following adjustments to measure the sale proceeds at fair value: any below-market terms shall be accounted for as a prepayment of lease payments; and any above-market terms shall be accounted for
