Good quality audits apply the above attributes across the various components based on a clear shared understanding between the group and component teams particularly in determining which components are significant and the audit approach required. These will be demonstrated through ongoing, timely interactions and robust challenge from both the group and component audit teams, as well as including topco teams in the discussion with local management and those charged with governance.

We have also seen some common shortcomings in planning, which auditors should seek to avoid: Each of the sub-components of planning had been treated as discrete activities completed by different people with limited cross correlation of information. Risk assessments were generic, theoretical and focused on the net risk, that is after the presumed application of a stated control and having regard to a view on managementâ€™s integrity.
