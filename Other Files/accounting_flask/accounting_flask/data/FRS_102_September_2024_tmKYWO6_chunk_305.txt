present value amount, when the effect of the time value of money is material. Example 1 Future operating losses 21A.1 An entity determines that it is probable that a segment of its operations will incur future operating losses for several years. Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event: There is no past event that obliges the entity to pay out resources. Conclusion: The entity does not recognise a provision for future operating losses. Expected future losses do not meet the definition of a liability. The expectation of future operating losses may be an indicator that one or more assets are impaired (see Section 27 Impairment of Assets). Example 2 Onerous contracts 21A.2 An onerous contract is one in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. The cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract and an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts. Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event: The entity is contractually required to pay out resources for which it will not receive commensurate benefits. Conclusion: If an entity has a contract that is onerous, the entity recognises and measures the present obligation under the contract as a provision.
