Any further refinements and modifications to this protocol will appear in subsequent revisions of this document. Intended Readership This document is intended for architects, 3rd party developers and other parties interested in building Transaction Engine client applications. Glossary of Terms See Appendix (section 7) Document Submission Protocol Document Submission Protocol The Document Submission Protocol (DSP) routes business transactions (e.g. Self-Assessment tax forms) submitted from either a Department Portal (e.g. the HMRC Online service Web site) or directly from an 3rd party application, through the Transaction Engine, to the appropriate HMRC system and retrieves the corresponding response. GovTalk Protocol DSP uses the GovTalk Message Envelope to encapsulate business transaction documents. The full description of the GovTalk 2.0 Envelope schema is available from HMRC. GovTalk documents are XML formatted and use the UTF-8 encoding standard. Messages are transported across the network using the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP). Portals, 3rd party applications and Departments must be capable of generating HTTP 1.1 POST requests and
