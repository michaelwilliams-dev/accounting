on the application of EU-adopted IFRS with disclosure exemptions. A qualifying entity may apply the reduced disclosure framework regardless of the financial reporting framework applied in the consolidated financial statements of the group. In developing the reduced disclosure framework the following principles, for determining which of the disclosure requirements in adopted IFRS should be required by qualifying entities, have been followed. The principles are specific to qualifying entities, so the impact on preparers and users of qualifying entity individual financial statements is a common theme to be considered in applying the principles. Relevance: Does the disclosure requirement provide information that is capable of making a difference to the decisions made by the users of the financial statements of a qualifying entity? Cost constraint on useful financial reporting: Does the disclosure requirement impose costs on the preparers of the financial statements of a qualifying entity that are not justified by the benefits to the users of those financial statements? Avoid gold plating: Does the disclosure requirement override an existing exemption provided by company law? In the 2015/16 cycle, further consideration was given to how the principle of ‘relevance’ should be applied in the context of disclosure by qualifying entities. It was noted that qualifying entities usually have few users of their financial statements, and particularly few users that would be external to the group that the qualifying entity is part of. Any external users are likely to be providers of credit to the qualifying entity whose interest is generally likely to be focused on information about the liquidity and solvency of the qualifying entity. This is because that information might be relevant to the ability of the qualifying entity to pay (or repay) any credit advanced. Respondents to the 2015/16 cycle continued to support these principles. Annual reviews of FRS 101
