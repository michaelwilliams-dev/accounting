features of life assurance contracts that: confer potentially valuable guarantees underlying the level or nature of policyholder benefits; or are options to change these benefits exercisable at the discretion of the policyholder. For the purposes of FRS 103, the term is used to refer only to those options and guarantees whose potential value is affected by the behaviour of financial variables, and not to potential changes in policyholder benefits arising solely from insurance risk (including mortality and morbidity), or from changes in the entity’s creditworthiness. It includes a financial guarantee or option that applies if a policy lapses, but does not include the option to surrender or allow a policy to lapse. IG3.18 To comply with paragraph IG3.14(c), an insurer should disclose: a description of the nature and extent of the options and guarantees; the basis of measurement for the amount at which these options and guarantees are stated, and the amount included, if any, for the additional payment that may arise in excess of the amounts expected to be paid if the policies did not include the option or guarantee feature; the main variables that determine the amount payable under the option or guarantee; and information on the potential effects of adverse changes in those market conditions that affect the entity’s obligations under options and guarantees. IG3.19 The requirement of paragraph IG3.18(d) may be met by disclosing: for options and guarantees that would result in additional payments to policyholders if current asset values and market rates continued unchanged (ie those that are ‘in the money’ for the policyholder), an indication of the change in these amounts if the variables moved adversely by a stated amount; and for options and guarantees that would result in additional payments to policyholders only if there was an adverse change in current asset values
