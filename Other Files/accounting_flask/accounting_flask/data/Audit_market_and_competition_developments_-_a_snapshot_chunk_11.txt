identify any risks to the resilience of an individual firm (and thus the market), whether these risks arise from within the firms’ audit practices or the wider multi-disciplinary firm. Our future work on competition in the audit market A key area of competition policy work in the year ahead will be market studies. Market studies are a useful regulatory tool for exploring issues in a market and can lead to a range of outcomes including richer insights about issues and proposals to improve how a market functions. Many sector regulators have powers to do market studies or they undertake market study type work. The CMA’s audit market study (2018/19) was an example of a large- scale Enterprise Act 2002 (EA02) market study but it is not the only approach to market studies. Ahead of having powers to do EA02 market studies, we plan to begin doing market studies from 2024. Commencing market studies now will enhance our ability to respond to stakeholder issues and concerns about the audit market, and will help develop our capability to do EA02 market studies in due course. We intend to take a flexible approach, adjusting the scope, scale, resourcing and timings of any market studies to fit the circumstances, including the topic(s) being explored. Next steps, including opportunity to comment Engaging with our stakeholders is vital if we are to realise a well-functioning audit market. We will continue working closely with others, including audit firms, on existing initiatives to improve competition, and in our future work. We will seek input from our stakeholders for any market studies. We will want to receive views and information when we launch any market studies, and engage regularly with any interested parties as these studies progress. We welcome any feedback on this snapshot to help inform our ongoing
