and loss account. Where the undertaking remains a subsidiary undertaking after the disposal, the non- controlling interest in that subsidiary undertaking should be increased by the carrying amount of the net identiﬁable assets that are now attributable to the non- controlling interest because of the decrease in the group’s interest. No amount for goodwill that arose on acquisition of the group’s interest in that subsidiary undertaking should be attributed to the non- controlling interest. (FRS 2 paragraph 52)|Where a parent reduces its holding in a subsidiary and control is retained, it shall be accounted for as a transaction between equity holders and the resulting change in non-controlling interest shall be accounted for in accordance with paragraph 22.19. No gain or loss shall be recognised at the date of disposal. (FRS 102 paragraph 9.19A) An entity shall treat changes in a parent’s controlling interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders. Accordingly, the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest shall be adjusted to reflect the change in the parent’s interest in the subsidiary’s net assets. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is so adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received, if any, shall be recognised directly in equity and attributed to equity holders of the parent. An entity shall not recognise a gain or loss on these changes. Also, an entity shall not recognise any change in the carrying amounts of assets (including goodwill) or liabilities as a result of such transactions. (FRS 102 paragraph 22.19)| There is a significant change in accounting treatment in this situation. Currently under FRS 2, a gain or loss is recognised on the disposal and a proportion of goodwill written off,
