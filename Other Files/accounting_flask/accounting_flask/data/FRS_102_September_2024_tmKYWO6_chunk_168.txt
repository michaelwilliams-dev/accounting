transaction price (adjusted for transaction costs except in the initial measurement of financial assets and liabilities that are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss) unless the arrangement constitutes, in effect, a financing transaction. An arrangement constitutes a financing transaction if payment is deferred beyond normal business terms or is financed at a rate of interest that is not a market rate, for example, providing interest-free credit to a buyer for the sale of goods or an interest-free or below market interest rate loan made to an employee. Except as set out in paragraph 11.13A, if the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, the entity shall measure the financial asset or financial liability at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument as determined at initial recognition adjusted for transaction costs. Examples – Financial assets| 1|For a long-term loan at a market rate of interest made to another entity, a receivable is recognised at the amount of the cash advanced to that entity plus transaction costs incurred by the entity (see the example following paragraph 11.20).| 2|For goods sold to a customer on short-term credit, a receivable is recognised at the undiscounted amount of cash receivable from that entity, which is normally the invoice price.| 3|For an item sold to a customer on two-years interest-free credit, a receivable is recognised at the present value of the cash receivable discounted using the prevailing market rate of interest for a similar receivable. In transactions conducted on an arm’s length basis the cash sales price for immediate settlement would normally approximate to the present value.| 4|For a cash purchase of another entity’s ordinary shares, the investment is recognised at the amount of cash paid to acquire the shares.| Examples – Financial
