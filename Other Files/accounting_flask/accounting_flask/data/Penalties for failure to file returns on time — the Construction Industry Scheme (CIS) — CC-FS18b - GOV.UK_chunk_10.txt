no liability to make payments, the amount of the increased penalty will depend on whether the behaviour was ‘deliberate’ or ‘deliberate and concealed’. The following table shows the amount of the increased penalty for each behaviour. Type of behaviour Amount of increased penalty Non-deliberate No penalty increase so we charge a minimum of £300 (unless the penalty is capped) Deliberate £1,500 Deliberate and concealed £3,000 Working out the reductions for the quality of disclosure (also referred to as ‘telling, helping and giving’) This does not apply to returns that only include subcontractors who are registered to receive gross payments. The quality of disclosure (telling, helping and giving) determines where the penalty will fall within the penalty range. The reduction we give depends on how much assistance you give us. For: telling — we give up to 30% helping — we give up to 40% giving access to records — we give up to 30% When we work out the quality of disclosure for deliberate and deliberate and concealed failures, we’ll also consider how long it’s taken you to tell us about the information you withheld. If it’s taken you a long time, (such as 3 years or more), we’ll usually restrict the maximum reduction we give for the quality of disclosure to 10 percentage points above the minimum of the penalty range. This means you will not benefit from the lowest penalty percentage that’s normally available. Calculating the increased penalty percentage rate or amount The increased penalty percentage rate or amount is determined by the penalty range and any reduction for the quality of disclosure, where these apply. Example We established that a customer had deliberately withheld information about their liability to make payments, by failing to file their return for that year. When challenged, they told us about the
