technical resources and other processes that support audit quality, such as risk panels, in-flight or cold reviews, with appropriate action taken to address findings.

A clear feedback loop into remedial actions and the assessment of their effectiveness.| We are developing additional workshops and briefings focused on the above areas and others where we have common findings, such as the audit of revenue, to provide more information on what good looks like.

Recent FRC publications of particular relevance include: Tier 2 and Tier 3 Audit Firms: Audit Quality
