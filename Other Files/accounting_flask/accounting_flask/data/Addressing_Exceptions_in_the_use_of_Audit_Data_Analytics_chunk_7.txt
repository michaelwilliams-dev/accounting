The understanding of the entity and its environment obtained in prior periods may help the auditor in developing expectations, but any assessment of potential outliers should be based mainly on the auditor’s understanding of the entity in the current period. Adjusting parameters to reduce the number of exceptions when the data input is known to be of poor quality. In this case, the poor quality data should be addressed before the ADA is applied. When refining parameters, the following processes are representative of best practice we have encountered in our outreach and audit inspections: Careful analysis of the outliers in order to assess if the parameters of the ADA require refinement. This includes applying the auditor’s understanding of the entity and its environment to determine if the outliers can be explained and parameters refined in order to identify outliers that warrant further investigation as exceptions. Discussion with management, in a similar fashion to how an auditor would when refining an expectation when undertaking analytical procedures in line with ISA (UK) 5208, to understand the underlying data and potential relationships better.9 Re-examination of the underlying data, if a full understanding was not possible before the ADA was used, to understand if the data is of sufficient quality to generate useful insight in the audit process. 7 ISA (UK) 300 (Revised June 2016) Planning an Audit of Financial Statements, Para 2 and 8(e) 8 ISA (UK) 520 Analytical Procedures, Para A5 9 ISA (UK) 520, Analytical Procedures, Para A12 Illustrative Example – Revenue ADA An auditor may make use of ADA in testing revenue, where the auditor runs a tool which looks at every Cr made to the Revenue ledger and analyses the population to determine if a corresponding Dr has been made to either Debtors or Cash The auditor sets this
