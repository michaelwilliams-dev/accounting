to be provided in the financial statements. Low probability of an inflow or outflow of economic benefits If the probability of an inflow or outflow of economic benefits is low, the most relevant information about the asset or liability may be information about the magnitude of the possible inflows or outflows, their possible timing and the factors affecting the probability of their occurrence. However, even if the probability of an inflow or outflow of economic benefits is low, recognition may provide relevant further information. Faithful representation Recognition of a particular asset or liability is appropriate if it provides not only relevant information, but also a faithful representation of that asset or liability and of any resulting income, expenses or changes in equity. Whether a faithful representation can be provided may be affected by the level of measurement uncertainty associated with the asset or liability or by other factors. Measurement uncertainty and outcome uncertainty For an asset or liability to be recognised, it must be measured. In many cases, such measurements must be estimated and are therefore subject to measurement uncertainty. The use of reasonable estimates is an essential part of the preparation of financial information and does not undermine the usefulness of the information if the estimates are clearly and accurately described and explained. Whether or not an asset or liability is recognised, a faithful representation of the asset or liability may need to include explanatory information about the uncertainties associated with the asset or liability’s existence or measurement, or with its outcome – the amount or timing of any inflow or outflow of economic benefits that will ultimately result from it. Derecognition Derecognition normally occurs when an item no longer meets the definition of an asset or of a liability: for an asset, derecognition normally occurs when the entity
