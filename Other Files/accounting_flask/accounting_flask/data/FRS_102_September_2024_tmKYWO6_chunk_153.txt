Impairment of Assets. 10.14B An entity uses measurement techniques and inputs to develop an accounting estimate. Measurement techniques include estimation techniques and valuation techniques. 10.14C The term ‘estimate’ in FRS 102 sometimes refers to an estimate that is not an accounting estimate as defined in this FRS. For example, it sometimes refers to an input used in developing accounting estimates. Changes in accounting estimates D An entity may need to change an accounting estimate if changes occur in the circumstances on which the accounting estimate was based or as a result of new information, new developments or more experience. The effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates unless they result from the correction of prior period errors. Except as provided in paragraph 10.9(c), a change in the measurement basis applied is a change in an accounting policy, and is not a change in an accounting estimate. When it is difficult to distinguish a change in an accounting policy from a change in an accounting estimate, the change is treated as a change in an accounting estimate. An entity shall recognise the effect of a change in an accounting estimate, other than a change to which paragraph 10.17 applies, prospectively by including it in profit or loss in: the period of the change, if the change affects that period only; or the period of the change and future periods, if the change affects both. To the extent that a change in an accounting estimate gives rise to changes in assets and liabilities, or relates to an item of equity, the entity shall recognise it by adjusting the carrying amount of the related asset, liability or equity item in the period of the change.
