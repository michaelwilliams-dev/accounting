and Groups (Accounts and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/409). The amendment introduced a new optional reporting framework for companies that meet the qualifying criteria of a micro-entity. Initially amendments were made to the Financial Reporting Standard for Smaller Entities (FRSSE) to accommodate the new regime and subsequently FRS 105 was developed in response to this change of UK company law. FRS 105 is based on FRS 102, but its accounting requirements are adapted to satisfy the legal requirements applicable to micro-entities and to reflect the simpler nature and smaller size of micro-entities. The application of the micro-entities regime is optional; however, a micro-entity that chooses to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the micro-entities regime is required to apply FRS 105. A company or LLP that qualifies for this regime, but chooses not to apply it, is required to apply another financial reporting standard (as set out in FRS 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements). Objective In developing financial reporting standards, the overriding objective of the FRC is to enable users of accounts to receive high-quality understandable financial reporting proportionate to the size and complexity of the entity and users’ information needs. In achieving this objective, the FRC aims to provide succinct financial reporting standards that: have consistency with global accounting standards through the application of an IFRS-based solution unless an alternative clearly better meets the overriding objective; balance improvement, through reflecting up-to-date thinking and developments in the way businesses operate and the transactions they undertake, with stability; 28 This Basis for Conclusions replaces the Accounting Council’s Advice and the Corporate Reporting Council’s Advice included in earlier editions of FRS 105. balance consistent principles for accounting by all UK and Republic of Ireland entities with proportionate and practical solutions, based on size, complexity, public interest and users’ information
