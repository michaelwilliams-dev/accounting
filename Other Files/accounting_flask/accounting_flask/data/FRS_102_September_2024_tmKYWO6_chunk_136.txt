The proportions of profit or loss and changes in equity allocated to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interest are determined on the basis of existing ownership interests and do not reflect the possible exercise or conversion of options or convertible instruments. Intragroup balances and transactions Intragroup balances and transactions, including income, expenses and dividends, are eliminated in full. Profits and losses resulting from intragroup transactions that are recognised in assets, such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are eliminated in full.
