to teach auditors how to exercise scepticism and challenge effectively. Mentoring and coaching programmes tailored for different groups of auditors and at various critical career points assist individuals in establishing supportive personal working relationships, facilitate knowledge exchange and enable role-modelling of behaviours expected of an auditor. Audit firms need to allocate sufficient time to training and coaching to ensure consistent and effective delivery. Good practice – training & coaching| “One firm involved professional actors in simulating a challenging and biased audited entity management in a fictional case study, where auditors are required to work in teams to complete the mock audit.” “One firm introduced training modules focusing on the auditor mindset and behaviours associated with the behaviour of challenge, for example, avoiding confirmation bias and assessing alternative scenarios and conflicting evidence.” “One firm operates a structured on-the-job learning programme involving junior auditors delivering sessions on challenge whilst being mentored by senior grades. This allowed the junior grades to drive thinking and discussion around challenge, giving them more confidence and knowledge to apply challenge on engagements.” “A junior auditor recalled a memorable training session where the auditors running the session role played a difficult conversation with the audited entity. This included showing how such a conversation might play out, and the language auditors might use to effectively challenge management. Compared to being shown the theory and definition of effective challenge in a presentation format, this auditor felt that the role-play technique was more helpful as it meant they were able to visualise what effective challenge might look like in the real world.”| Culture Learning Environment| Culture| Audit Firm Operating Model| Ecosystem| Auditors are equipped with the knowledge and skills of professional scepticism and challenge.|Displaying the behaviours of professional scepticism and challenge are encouraged by the audit firm.|Auditors are enabled to apply
