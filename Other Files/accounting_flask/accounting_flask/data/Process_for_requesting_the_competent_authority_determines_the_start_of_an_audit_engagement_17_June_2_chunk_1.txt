Process for requesting that the competent authority determines the start of an audit engagement period in cases of uncertainty Article 17(8) of EU Audit Regulation (EU 537/2014) states that an audit firm must immediately report any uncertainty1 as to the start date of the audit engagement ('the relevant date') to the Competent Authority and that the Competent Authority shall ultimately determine the relevant date. In that the issue is also likely to be of significant importance to public interest entities themselves, the FRC will consider requests by such entities to determine the start of an audit engagement period in cases of uncertainty. This Process Note gives applicants guidance on the information to be provided with requests, sets out the process which the FRC (as the Competent Authority) will follow in considering applications, and describes the mechanism by which applicants may seek a review of a determination. The additional Guidance Note set out below provides further information on the factors the FRC will take into account in making a determination. Further guidance can be found in Auditor Regulation – Supplementary Information: Q&A on the implications of the EU reforms (retendering and rotation) published by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills. The FRC will keep this Process Note under review and will update it as appropriate.
