HSR: Health Services Research 34:5 Part II (Decernber 1999) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1089055/pdf/hsresearch00022-0025.pdf All fieldwork was conducted online, or via telephone, to minimise potential disruption to auditorâ€™s operational duties. In scheduling our meetings, we were flexible in our approach and mindful of the competing work priorities of research participants. All fieldwork was moderated by trained facilitators from the BritainThinks team, and comprised: 21 auditor focus groups, each lasting 90 minutes and comprising on average 5 auditors (but ranging from 4-6 in each group) to achieve a total sample of 120 auditors below partner level. Groups were split by seniority, with 3 groups per Tier 1 audit firm (as defined above) including: 7 x Associate / Senior Associate focus groups; 7 x Manager / Assistant Manager focus groups; 7 x Senior Manager / Director focus groups. All auditors were audit engagement facing and were randomly selected from anonymised staff lists provided by the audit firms, with the aim of gaining as representative a picture as possible of auditor experiences (rather than allowing audit firms to nominate potential participants). Due to the randomised selection process, auditor demographics (apart from our stratified seniority bandings) were allowed to fall out naturally. By design, the FRC did not have access to our meeting notes or working papers, and all comments reproduced in this report were anonymised (including any firm-branded initiatives) so that none could be attributable at the individual or firm level. This group format allowed coverage of a greater number of more junior auditors in the research, and the interactive element enabled auditors to build on thoughts of their colleagues throughout the discussions. Splitting groups by seniority and firm helped to ensure some homogeneity in experiences and fostered a safe environment where auditors felt comfortable being open and honest in their views. 21 audit partner in-depth interviews,
