have been raised about how changing regulatory requirements internationally could affect the market. Suppliers of sustainability assurance in the UK may need to pivot and respond to a developing regulatory framework. We now want to explore these issues further through a market study. We want to ensure the UK’s sustainability assurance market is working effectively, producing high quality assurance to support the production of useful, reliable reporting for investors, without creating undue burdens and costs on business. We want to understand if, and how, any developments in this market could affect the UK’s statutory audit market. We want to ensure there is effective competition to help drive economic growth. Market studies are a useful regulatory tool for exploring issues in a market. They can lead to a range of outcomes including richer insights about issues and proposals to improve how a market functions. In our draft plan and budget 2024/53, we set out our intention to build our capability to deliver market studies under existing FRC powers. This will be the FRC’s first market study. We are keen to hear from any organisation or individual who may wish to respond to this invitation to comment on the UK’s sustainability assurance market. The remainder of the document provides further information to help inform responses. Some specific consultation questions and details of how to respond are set out on page 6. 1 A study on sustainability reporting and assurance across 21 jurisdictions found that the UK had the fastest rate of growth in sustainability assurance between 2019 and 2021, rising from 55% to 82%.
