Process for applications to extend the maximum duration of the audit engagement Sections 487 and 489 of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 16 of the EU Audit Regulation (EU537/2014) place time limits on the length of an audit engagement ('the maximum engagement period') in relation to public-interest entities. Public-interest entities must retender every ten years, and (where a retender has taken place) the duration of the audit engagement must not exceed twenty years without the approval of the Competent Authority. The Companies Act 2006 provides1 that, upon a request by a public-interest entity ('the applicant'), the maximum engagement period may be extended with the approval of the Competent Authority for up to two years. In a case where a 10-year audit engagement is being extended, the Competent Authority may only grant an extension if the appointment of the auditor for the first complete financial year following the end of that period is made following a selection procedure carried out in accordance with the relevant 'selection requirements'2. In any case, the Competent Authority may only approve an extension if it is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist. In no case can an extension be granted which would result in an overall audit engagement period exceeding 22 years.
