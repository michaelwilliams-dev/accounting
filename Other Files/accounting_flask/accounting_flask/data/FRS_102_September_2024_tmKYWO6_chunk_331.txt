possible consideration amounts. An expected value may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration if an entity has a large number of contracts with similar characteristics. The most likely amount – the most likely amount is the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts (ie the single most likely outcome of the contract). The most likely amount may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration if the contract has only two possible outcomes (eg an entity either achieves a performance bonus or does not). An entity shall apply one method consistently throughout the contract when estimating the amount of variable consideration. The information that an entity uses to estimate the amount of variable consideration would typically be similar to the information that the entity’s management uses during the bid-and-proposal process and in establishing prices for the goods or services promised to the customer. An entity shall include in the transaction price an amount of variable consideration estimated in accordance with paragraph 23.44 only to the extent that it is highly probable that it will be entitled to the cumulative amount of revenue recognised when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall update the estimate of variable consideration included in the transaction price to reflect any relevant changes in circumstances. An entity shall account for changes in the estimate of the transaction price in accordance with paragraphs 23.75 to 23.77. Sales-based or usage-based royalties An entity shall not apply paragraphs 23.44 to 23.47 to a sales-based or usage-based royalty provided in exchange for a licence of intellectual property when the licence of intellectual property is the sole or predominant item to which the royalty relates. Instead, an entity
