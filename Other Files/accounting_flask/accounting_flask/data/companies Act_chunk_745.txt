of 28 days beginning on the date on which it is passed. A company's articles may prohibit or restrict the exercise of the power conferred by this section. Chapter 3 of Part 3 (resolutions affecting a company's constitution) applies to a resolution under this section. Calculation of new nominal values For each class of share the new nominal value of each share is calculated as follows: Step One Take the aggregate of the old nominal values of all the shares of that class. Step Two Translate that amount into the new currency at the rate of exchange specified in the resolution. Step Three Divide that amount by the number of shares in the class. Effect of redenomination The redenomination of shares does not affect any rights or obligations of members under the company's constitution, or any restrictions affecting members under the company's constitution. In particular, it does not affect entitlement to dividends (including entitlement to dividends in a particular currency), voting rights or any liability in respect of amounts unpaid on shares. For this purpose the company's constitution includes the terms on which any shares of the company are allotted or held. Subject to subsection (1), references to the old nominal value of the shares in any agreement or statement, or in any deed, instrument or document, shall (unless the context otherwise requires) be read after the resolution takes effect as references to the new nominal value of the shares.
