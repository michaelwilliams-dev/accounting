been integrated. Also the entity shall follow the requirements for cash-generating units in this section when calculating the recoverable amount of, and allocating impairment losses and reversals to assets belonging to, the acquired entity or group of entities. Reversal of an impairment loss An impairment loss recognised for goodwill shall not be reversed in a subsequent period. For all assets other than goodwill, if and only if the reasons for the impairment loss have ceased to apply, an impairment loss shall be reversed in a subsequent period. An entity shall assess at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased. Indications that an impairment loss may have decreased or may no longer exist are generally the opposite of those set out in paragraph 27.9. If any such indication exists, the entity shall determine whether all or part of the prior impairment loss should be reversed. The procedure for making that determination will depend on whether the prior impairment loss on the asset was based on: the recoverable amount of that individual asset (see paragraph 27.30); or the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs (see paragraph 27.31). Reversal where recoverable amount was estimated for an individual impaired asset When the prior impairment loss was based on the recoverable amount of the individual impaired asset, the following requirements apply: The entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset at the current reporting date. If the estimated recoverable amount of the asset exceeds its carrying amount, the entity shall increase the carrying amount to recoverable amount, subject to the limitation described in (c) below. That increase is a reversal of an impairment loss. The entity shall recognise the reversal immediately in
