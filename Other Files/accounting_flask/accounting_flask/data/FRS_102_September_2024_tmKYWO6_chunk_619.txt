but generally has the same effect. The FRC has also simplified language in response to feedback; for example, the requirements for discounts and variable consideration have been combined into a single requirement. B23.8 Following stakeholder feedback the FRC concluded that many topics in Section 23 should be more closely aligned to the corresponding requirements in IFRS 15 than the proposals set out in FRED 82. This included retaining the defined term ‘performance obligation’ and aligning the requirements for contract modifications, determining whether an entity is a principal or an agent, and determining whether an entity transfers control of a good or service over time or at a point in time. The FRC also concluded that the proposed expedient from accounting for an option that provides a material right to a customer as a separate performance obligation when the effect of doing so is not significant to the accounting for the individual contract was unnecessary because the entity can rely on the general concept of materiality to simplify the accounting for those items, when appropriate. B23.9 The FRC concluded that, whilst the requirements should allow an entity to use an accounting policy for revenue that meets the requirements of both FRS 102 and IFRS 15 to promote efficiency within groups, it is appropriate to offer accounting simplifications compared to IFRS 15 to provide proportionate and practical solutions that are cost effective to apply. These simplifications include: not requiring an entity to adjust for the effects of time value of money on payments received in advance (paragraph 23.59); flexibility in allocating discounts or variable consideration to the contract (paragraph 23.74); an accounting policy choice on whether an entity capitalises its costs to obtain a contract with a customer (paragraph 23.113); and greater use of hindsight when estimating variable consideration and evaluating contract
