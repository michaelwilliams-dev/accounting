extent that they have not been reduced by depreciation prior to the date of transition) based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the date of transition and records the corresponding adjustment in equity. Example 3 Revaluation as deemed cost Entity C has two properties, A and B. Neither Property A nor Property B is an investment property. Entity C has an accounting policy to revalue its properties and to depreciate them over a useful life of 50 years. Property A was acquired on 31 December 1980 at a cost of CU1,000 and has been revalued on a regular basis; the last time was on 31 December 2010 when its value was recorded in the financial statements at CU100,000 and its remaining useful life was 20 years. There has been no significant change in the value of Property A since that revaluation. Property B was acquired on 31 December 2010, at a cost of CU50,000. Property B has never been revalued as it was purchased in the same year that the most recent valuation was carried out and at that time its cost was the best available evidence of its valuation. There has been no impairment in its value. On transition (1 January 2014): Entity C decides not to continue its policy of revaluation as permitted by FRS 102. Property A Paragraph 35.10(d) provides an optional exemption from restating the value of the property based on its original cost. Therefore Entity C has the following two choices in relation to Property A: it could elect to use the most recent revaluation from 2010 (being CU100,000) as its deemed cost at that date and no further adjustment is required; or it could restate the property to its original cost of CU1,000. 4 Being CU10,000 x 11/15 years If the revalued
