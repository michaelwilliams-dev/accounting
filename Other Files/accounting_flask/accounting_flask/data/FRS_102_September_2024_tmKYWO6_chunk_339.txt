or service (ie an asset) to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. For each performance obligation identified, an entity shall determine at contract inception whether the performance obligation is satisfied over time (in accordance with paragraphs 23.81 to 23.84) or satisfied at a point in time (in accordance with paragraphs 23.85 to 23.89). Goods and services are assets, even if only momentarily, when they are received and used (as in the case of many services). Control of an asset refers to the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining economic benefits that may flow from, the asset. Performance obligations satisfied over time An entity transfers control of a good or service over time, and therefore satisfies a performance obligation over time, if one of the following criteria is met: the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs (eg routine or recurring services such as a cleaning service). If an entity cannot readily identify whether this is the case, a performance obligation is satisfied over time if another entity would not need to substantially re-perform the work that the entity has completed to date if that other entity were to fulfil the remaining performance obligation (eg in a freight logistics contract); the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced (eg in the case of a construction contract in which the customer controls the work in progress); or the entity’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use to the entity (see paragraphs 23.82 to 23.83) and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (see
