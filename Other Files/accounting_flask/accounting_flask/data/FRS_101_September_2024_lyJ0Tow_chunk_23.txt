In addition, consistency is not required in the following situations: when the parent company does not prepare consolidated accounts; or when some subsidiaries are charities (consistency is not needed between the framework used for these and for other subsidiaries). Where the directors of a parent company prepare IAS group accounts and IAS individual accounts, there only has to be consistency across the individual financial statements of the subsidiaries. A2.5 All companies, other than those which elect or are required to prepare IAS individual accounts in accordance with the Act, prepare Companies Act individual accounts.

Financial instruments measured at fair value A2.5B Paragraph 8 of FRS 101 permits qualifying entities that are not financial institutions to take advantage of exemptions from the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
