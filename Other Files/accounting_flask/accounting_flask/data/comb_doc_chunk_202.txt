Credit Union A’s liquidity policy is to smooth the mismatches between maturing assets and liabilities and to provide a degree of protection against any unexpected developments that may arise. Note 2 provides further details about the impact of the maturity mismatch on the going concern status of Credit Union A. Market risk: Market risk is generally comprised of interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk. Credit Union A conducts all its transactions in sterling and does not deal in derivatives or commodity markets. Therefore Credit Union A is not exposed to any form of currency risk or other price risk. Interest rate risk: Credit Union A’s main interest rate risk arises from differences between the interest rate exposures on the receivables and payables that form an integral part of a credit union’s operations. Credit Union A considers rates of interest receivable when deciding on the dividend rate payable on subscribed capital. Credit Union A does not use interest rate options to hedge its own positions.
