the underlying asset), or changes in circumstances (eg default by the lessee), do not give rise to a new classification of a lease for accounting purposes. In classifying a sublease, an intermediate lessor shall classify the sublease as a finance lease or an operating lease as follows: If the head lease is a short-term lease that the entity, as a lessee, has accounted for applying paragraph 20.6, the sublease shall be classified as an operating lease. Otherwise, the sublease shall be classified by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, rather than by reference to the underlying asset (eg the item of property, plant or equipment that is the subject of the lease). Finance leases Recognition and measurement At the commencement date, a lessor shall recognise assets held under a finance lease in its statement of financial position and present them as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Initial measurement The lessor shall use the interest rate implicit in the lease to measure the net investment in the lease. In the case of a sublease, if the interest rate implicit in the sublease cannot be readily determined, an intermediate lessor may use the discount rate used for the head lease (adjusted for any initial direct costs associated with the sublease) to measure the net investment in the sublease. Initial direct costs, other than those incurred by manufacturer or dealer lessors, are included in the initial measurement of the net investment in the lease and reduce the amount of income recognised over the lease term. The interest rate implicit in the lease is defined in such a way that the initial direct costs are included automatically in the net investment in the lease; there is no need to add them separately.
