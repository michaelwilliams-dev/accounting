the amendments of the underlying IFRS Accounting Standard. UK exit from the European Union In January 2020, the UK exited the European Union. As a result, changes were required to UK company law to ensure that it continues to operate effectively. FRS 101 was amended in December 2020 to reflect these changes. This included amending the references to ‘EU-adopted IFRS’ to read ‘adopted IFRS’, which incorporates the accounting standards referred to in both UK and Irish company law (UK-adopted international accounting standards and EU-adopted IFRS, respectively). Early application is permitted by entities in the UK, which is consistent with the transitional arrangements provided in UK company law for entities preparing ‘IAS accounts’. Application of the amendments to an accounting period beginning before 1 January 2021 allows entities to use IAS that are adopted for use within the UK after 31 December 2020, in addition to IFRS as adopted in the EU as at this date.
