may be acquired in exchange for a non-monetary asset or assets, or a combination of monetary and non-monetary assets. An entity shall measure the cost of such an intangible asset at fair value unless: the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance; or the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable. In that case, the assetâ€™s cost is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up. [Replaced by paragraph 18.8A] [Moved to paragraph 18.8C] [Moved to paragraph 18.8D] Past expenses not to be recognised as an asset Expenditure on an intangible item that was initially recognised as an expense shall not be recognised at a later date as part of the cost of an asset. Subsequent measurement An entity shall measure intangible assets after initial recognition using the cost model (in accordance with paragraph 18.18A) or the revaluation model (in accordance with paragraphs 18.18B to 18.18H). Where the revaluation model is selected, this shall be applied to all intangible assets in the same class of asset. If an intangible asset in a class of revalued intangible assets cannot be revalued because there is no active market for this asset, the asset shall be carried at its cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Cost model 18.18A Under the cost model, an entity shall measure its assets at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. The requirements for amortisation are set out in paragraphs 18.19 to 18.24. Revaluation model 18.18B Under the revaluation model, an intangible asset shall be carried at a revalued amount, being its fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated amortisation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses, provided that the fair value can be determined by reference to an active market.
