10(2) of Schedule 1 to the Regulations). Calculation of goodwill where a business combination is achieved in stages A3.18 Paragraph 9 of Schedule 6 to the Regulations sets out the requirements for the acquisition method of accounting, which results in goodwill (or negative goodwill) being calculated as the difference between: the fair value of the group’s share of identifiable assets and liabilities of the subsidiary at the date control is achieved; and the total acquisition cost of the interests held by the group in that subsidiary. This applies even where part of the acquisition cost arises from purchases at earlier dates. A3.19 In most cases, this method provides a practical means of applying acquisition accounting because it does not require retrospective assessments of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the subsidiary. In certain circumstances, however, not using fair values at the dates of earlier purchases while using acquisition costs which in part relate to earlier purchases may result in accounting that is inconsistent with the way the investment has been treated previously and, for that reason, may fail to give a true and fair view. A3.20 For example, an undertaking that has been treated as an associate may then be acquired by that group as a subsidiary. Using the method required by the Regulations and paragraph 9.19B of FRS 102 to calculate goodwill on such an acquisition has the effect that the group’s share of profits or losses and reserve movements of its associate becomes reclassified as goodwill (usually negative goodwill). A similar problem may arise where the group has substantially restated its investment in an undertaking that subsequently becomes its subsidiary. For example, where such an investment has been written down because it is impaired, the effect of applying the Regulations’ method of acquisition accounting
