Between 2022 and 2023, a total of 14 companies switched providers from non-audit firms to audit firms. In contrast, 6 companies switched from an audit firm provider to a non-audit firm provider.

By contrast, the provision of assurance with reference to ISO 14064 and AA 1000 remained relatively consistent. Figure 9. Assurance standards used by FTSE 350 companies in 2019 and 20236 Source: Minerva Analytics Ltd 83% of assurance engagements for FTSE 350 companies in 2023 involved limited assurance over some, or all, of the metrics being assured. Figure 10 shows that, with the exception of the AA 1000 standard, the vast majority of assurance provided under each assurance standard was ‘limited’. 6 Note: Figure 10 captures each instance an assurance standard is referenced by the reporting company when disclosing the assured information. In many cases, assurance opinions may make reference to more than one assurance standard, so the total will exceed 100% in any year. Figure 10.
