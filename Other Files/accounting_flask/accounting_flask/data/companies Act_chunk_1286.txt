This section has limited application in relation to documents delivered before it comes fully into force: see section 1087B. “Relevant date of birth information” means— information as to the day of the month (but not the month or year) on which a director (or proposed director) was born; information as to the day of the month (but not the month or year) on which a registrable person in relation to the company was born. Information about a director (or proposed director) or registrable person does not cease to be relevant date of birth information when they cease to be a director (or proposed director) or registrable person. Subsection (1)(b) does not affect the availability for public inspection of the same information contained in material derived from a part of a document that was not required to contain the information.
