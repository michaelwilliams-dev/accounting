Use of trading names Many businesses, whether sole traders, partnerships or companies, conduct all, or part, of their business using one, or sometimes more, trading names. However, a trading name has no legal status of its own and is simply a brand name for the underlying legal entity. When registering for CIS, subcontractors will need to provide us with their legal name but they can also give us one trading name, if they wish. When the subcontractor subsequently enters into a contract with a contractor, they should give the contractor details of their legal name, as registered on our computer system, together with their UTR, and National Insurance number, or company registration number when they are a company.

When this happens, we’ll tell the contractor to make deductions at the higher rate from any payments to the subcontractor. Contractors should enter the subcontractor’s name, as it’s recorded on our computer system, onto the monthly return. Payment to third parties Nominees If payment is to be made to a subcontractor’s nominee, for example, a gang member, workmate or the subcontractor’s relative, the contractor must verify both the subcontractor and the nominee. For payment to be made gross to the nominee, both the subcontractor and the nominee must be registered for gross payment. If the subcontractor is not registered for gross payment, payment under deduction must be made to the nominee using the rate applicable to the subcontractor. This means that if the subcontractor is registered for payment under deduction, the standard rate of deduction must be applied to the payment
