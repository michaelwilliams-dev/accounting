that Audit Committees work best when they are made up of committed, engaged members who have sufficient financial literacy and expertise to engage with the detail and interrogate an audit, as well as when they clearly see themselves as independent from the audited entity. Further solutions and opportunities that can be employed to strengthen desired auditor behaviour Alongside these key drivers and barriers, this research has also identified a number of opportunities for audit firms to strengthen professional scepticism and effective challenge, including: Plan effectively for each engagement, factoring in the role of the senior auditors as ‘leaders in motion’: Timescales require extra breathing room to be built in specifically for scepticism and challenge. Additionally, senior auditors workloads should factor in their coaching and modelling responsibilities, particularly for those who are new to the senior level and may need time to develop soft skills around feedback and coaching. Embed hybrid working practices effectively: Central to ensuring new ways of working are effective is utilising virtual channels for informal as well as formal discussion between audit engagement teams. This includes mirroring opportunities for audit managers and junior auditors to attend calls that would be useful to observe in much the same way that they may be pulled into an ad hoc meeting ‘on-site’, and maximising the use of face-to-face interactions for socialising between all seniority levels. Ensure that remuneration and reward has close links to the desired behaviours: Building explicit links between specific quality behaviours at all levels, not just partners, would help to evidence the continual importance of delivering high quality audit engagements on a consistent basis. This could be achieved by greater recognition for those with consistently strong feedback on their ability to be sceptical and effectively challenge management, and could be backed by meaningful, firm- wide reward and
