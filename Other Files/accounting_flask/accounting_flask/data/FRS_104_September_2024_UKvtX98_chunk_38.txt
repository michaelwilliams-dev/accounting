which the related tax loss occurs. Section 29 Income Tax of FRS 102 provides that ‘an entity shall recognise a current tax asset for the benefit of a tax loss that can be carried back to recover tax paid in a previous period’. A corresponding reduction of tax expense or increase of tax income is also recognised. A2.23 Section 29 of FRS 102 provides that unrelieved tax losses shall only be recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. A2.24 To illustrate, an entity that reports quarterly has an operating loss carryforward of CU10,000 for income tax purposes at the start of the current financial year for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised. The entity earns CU10,000 in the first quarter of the current year and expects to earn CU10,000 in each of the three remaining quarters. Excluding the carryforward, the estimated average annual income tax rate is expected to be 40%. Tax expense is as follows: |1st Quarter|2nd Quarter|3rd Quarter|4th Quarter|Annual| Tax expense|CU3,000|CU3,000|CU3,000|CU3,000|CU12,000| Contractual or anticipated purchase price changes A2.25 Volume rebates or discounts and other contractual changes in the prices of raw materials, labour, or other purchased goods and services are anticipated in interim periods, by both the payer and the recipient, if it is probable that they have been earned or will take effect. Thus, contractual rebates and discounts are anticipated but discretionary rebates and discounts are not anticipated because the resulting asset or liability would not satisfy the conditions that an asset must be a resource controlled by the entity as a result of a past event and that a liability must be a present obligation whose settlement is expected to result in an outflow of
