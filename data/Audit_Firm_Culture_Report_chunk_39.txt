hasn’t been established, particularly where teams have been largely or exclusively working remotely and hybrid working practices have not been effectively embedded, junior auditors were particularly felt to be lacking confidence and to be more deferential. These auditors can fear being seen to ‘go over their managers’ heads’, are less inclined to push back against manager decisions or views, and may see that their challenges are not addressed or escalated. Where there is an absence of challenge at higher levels (e.g. if the senior auditors concur based on corroborating evidence only) this can filter down to junior team members, causing a strain on relationships, hindering open discussion and weakening standards.

Similarly, a lack of perceived safe spaces in which to share ideas can further limit confidence in offering challenge and exerting professional scepticism, with some senior auditors acknowledging that junior auditors may be reluctant to do so.
