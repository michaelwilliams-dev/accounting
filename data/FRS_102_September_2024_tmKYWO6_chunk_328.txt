with a material right and does not give rise to a separate performance obligation. Options that may provide a material right to customers include sales incentives, customer award credits (or points), contract renewal options or other discounts on future goods or services. If an option provides a material right to a customer, the customer is in effect paying the entity in advance for future goods or services. As a consequence, the entity recognises revenue when those future goods or services are transferred or when the option expires. If a customer is granted an option to renew a contract on similar terms (ie acquire future goods or services that are similar to the original goods or services in the contract) and the option provides the customer with a material right which the entity accounts for as a separate performance obligation, as a practical alternative to estimating the stand-alone selling price of the option in accordance with paragraphs 23.67 to 23.71, the entity may allocate the transaction price to the option by allocating the total expected consideration to the total goods or services expected to be transferred (ie including expected renewal periods in both cases). As a result of paragraph 23.34, the amount of the transaction price allocated to the renewal option at contract inception is the difference between: the transaction price for the original contract; and the amount of the total expected consideration allocated, in accordance with paragraph 23.34, to the goods or services that the entity is required to transfer to the customer under the original contract.
