the audit committee. Audit firms need to give clear messages to audited entities about their robust commitment to audit quality, independence, scepticism and challenge. This enables management and audit committees to understand what is expected from them and what the audit process will involve. This also enables audit firms to outline the distinction between providing a ‘service’ to an ‘audit client’ and performing an independent audit in the interests of shareholders and the wider public. An audit committee should set clear expectations and boundaries of what is desired of an auditor in order to deliver a good quality audit, laying out the extent of constructive challenge that stakeholders expect to see between the audit firm and the audited entity’s management. At the audit completion stage the audit committee can then assess the extent to which this constructive challenge has been evident. Appropriate resourcing is key to enabling scepticism and challenge during an audit, therefore an audit committee that asks questions about the resourcing of the audit will obtain valuable information on this vital contributor to audit quality. Understanding the audit resourcing allows the audit committee to understand, and if necessary, question the time that is spent on the higher-risk and key judgement areas where there is likely to be more challenge. For example, the audit committee may ask questions to understand the extent of use of specialists on complex technical areas or overall partner hours to assess the quality of direction and supervision by the partner. Audit committees can take actions to understand the extent to which there has been effective challenge during the audit, for example by asking the audit partner to talk about any conflicts with management and how these conflicts have been resolved. Audit committees can also interact and engage with the audit team performing the work
