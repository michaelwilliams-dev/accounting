that a firm has failed to notify us of a change required by Part 15, or there is evidence that a registered firm or RI may no longer meet one or more of the registration requirements, it can consider: Agreeing Undertakings with the firm or RI. Attaching Conditions on the firm’s or RI’s registration. Suspending or involuntarily removing the firm’s or RI’s registration. Which option is adopted will be dependent on the nature and seriousness of the issue. Additional ongoing obligations PIE audit firms have a number of specific obligations including: Reporting breaches of ethical requirements to the FRC: Firms must have in place appropriate procedures to prevent and detect breaches of ethical requirements, including the specific (and more restrictive) requirements for PIE audits. Firms must submit ethics breach reports biannually to the FRC (within two months) and make interim reports if significant breaches are identified. Details of the process for submitting ethical breach reports to the FRC may be found here. We review all the ethical breach reports we receive and may make further enquiries with a firm to understand more about a breach or its causes. Significant breaches may be referred to the FRC’s Case Examiner to consider whether further action should be taken (refer to page 27 for more information on the work of the Case Examiner). Preparing and publishing an annual Transparency Report: The Transparency Report must comply with rules mandated by EU Regulation 537/2014 Article 13 (which have been retained by the UK on leaving the European Union) and the reporting requirements set out in the Audit Firm Governance Code 2022 (AFGC) if it is adopted by the firm. If a firm has issued an audit report on one or more major local audits, it must also comply with The Local Auditors (Transparency) Regulations 2020.
