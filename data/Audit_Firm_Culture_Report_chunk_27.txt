partners to drive scepticism and challenge when first establishing themselves, as they are felt to have less influence on junior colleagues, and may be more sensitive to the potential impacts on their reputation by delivering late (and are therefore less likely to challenge audited entities). Implications: How communication and leadership can drive desired auditor behaviours By stressing quality, scepticism and challenge in top-down communications (both formal and informal) Clear and effective communication, both internally between auditors and externally with audited entities, is integral to a high-quality audit. Top-down communication sets the tone for firm quality, values and expected behaviours, explicitly tying scepticism and challenge into firm values and reputation to ensure they are at the forefront of auditorsâ€™ minds. Within this, it is critical that communications are as specific as possible about the two behaviours, rather than vaguely referencing quality in the round. Communicating by showing rather than telling is also key in order to go beyond words, and to help auditors to see the behaviours of scepticism and challenge in practice so they can understand how to engage in these behaviours themselves. Senior auditors should lead by example, challenging audited entities where needed and encouraging junior auditors to consider potential issues at the start of audits. By capitalising on partners as leaders in the business to model and embody the behaviours of scepticism and challenge Partners play a central role in driving behaviours and are seen as key to firm-wide messages translating into action, by ensuring they are embedded in every interaction on a day-to-day basis through verbal and non-verbal reinforcement and leading by example in their interactions with audited entities. Auditors gaining more exposure to partners as leaders when working remotely and/or in the office (e.g. by being invited to calls or partners approaching or messaging auditors directly).
