its financial statements, that another presentation or classification would be more appropriate having regard to the criteria for the selection and application of accounting policies in Section 8 Accounting Policies, Estimates and Errors; or this FRS requires a change in presentation. When the presentation or classification of items in the financial statements is changed, a micro-entity shall reclassify comparative amounts unless the reclassification is impracticable. Comparative information Except when this FRS permits or requires otherwise, a micro-entity shall present comparative information in respect of the preceding period for all amounts presented in the current periodâ€™s financial statements. Materiality This FRS specifies information that is required to be included in the financial statements of a micro-entity, which includes the notes. A micro-entity need not provide a specific disclosure required by this FRS if the information resulting from that disclosure is not material, except when required by the Act2 regardless of materiality. Complete set of financial statements A complete set of financial statements of a micro-entity shall include the following: a statement of financial position as at the reporting date with notes included at the foot of the statement3; and an income statement for the reporting period. Because paragraph 3.7 requires comparative amounts in respect of the previous period for all amounts presented in the financial statements, a complete set of financial statements means that a micro-entity shall present, as a minimum, two of each of the required financial statements and related notes. In a complete set of financial statements, a micro-entity shall present each financial statement with equal prominence. A micro-entity may use titles for the financial statements other than those used in this FRS as long as they are not misleading. Identification of the financial statements A micro-entity shall clearly identify each of the financial statements and the notes. In
