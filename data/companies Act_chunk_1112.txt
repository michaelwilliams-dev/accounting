Enforcement by the court If, on the application of the Panel, the court is satisfied— that there is a reasonable likelihood that a person will contravene a rule-based requirement, or that a person has contravened a rule-based requirement or a disclosure requirement, the court may make any order it thinks fit to secure compliance with the requirement. In subsection (1) “the court” means the High Court or, in Scotland, the Court of Session. Except as provided by subsection (1), no person— has a right to seek an injunction, or in Scotland, has title or interest to seek an interdict or an order for specific performance, to prevent a person from contravening (or continuing to contravene) a rule-based requirement or a disclosure requirement. In this section— “contravene” includes fail to comply; “disclosure requirement” means a requirement imposed under section 947; “rule-based requirement” means a requirement imposed by or under rules. No action for breach of statutory duty etc Contravention of a rule-based requirement or a disclosure requirement does not give rise to any right of action for breach of statutory duty. Contravention of a rule-based requirement does not make any transaction void or unenforceable or (subject to any provision made by rules) affect the validity of any other thing. In this section— “contravention” includes failure to comply; “disclosure requirement” and “rule-based requirement” have the same meaning as in section 955.
