in the annual report how these and the matters set out in section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 have been considered in board discussions and decision-making. The board should keep engagement mechanisms under review so that they remain effective. For engagement with the workforce,3 one or a combination of the following methods should be used: a director appointed from the workforce; a formal workforce advisory panel; or a designated non-executive director. If the board has not chosen one or more of these methods, it should explain what alternative arrangements are in place and why it considers that they are effective. There should be a means for the workforce to raise concerns in confidence and – if they wish – anonymously. The board should routinely review these arrangements and the reports arising from their operation. It should ensure that arrangements are in place for the proportionate and independent investigation of such matters and for follow-up action. The board should take action to identify and manage conflicts of interest, including those resulting from significant shareholdings, and ensure that the influence of third parties does not compromise or override independent judgement. Where directors have concerns about the operation of the board or the management of the company that cannot be resolved, their concerns should be recorded in the board minutes. On resignation, a non-executive director should provide a written statement to the chair, for circulation to the board, if they have any such concerns. 1 The update should be published on the company’s website, the Regulatory Information Service used by the company, or both. 2 Details of significant votes against and related company updates are available on the Public Register maintained by The Investment Association – www.theinvestmentassociation.org/publicregister.html 3 See Code guidance for a description of ‘workforce’ in this context.
