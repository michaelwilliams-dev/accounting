entity often has the right to appoint or veto the appointment of the intermediary’s trustees (or its directors or the equivalent). The payments made to the intermediary and the payments made by the intermediary are often cash payments but may involve other transfers of value. Examples of intermediate payment arrangements are employee share ownership plans (ESOPs) and employee benefit trusts that are used to facilitate employee shareholdings under remuneration schemes. In a typical employee benefit trust arrangement for share-based payments, an entity makes payments to a trust or guarantees borrowing by the trust, and the trust uses its funds to accumulate assets to pay the entity’s employees for services the employees have rendered to the entity. Although the trustees of an intermediary must act at all times in accordance with the interests of the beneficiaries of the intermediary, most intermediaries (particularly those established as a means of remunerating employees) are specifically designed so as to serve the purposes of the sponsoring entity, and to ensure that there will be minimal risk of any conflict arising between the duties of the trustees of the intermediary and the interest of the sponsoring entity, such that there is nothing to encumber implementation of the wishes of the sponsoring entity in practice. Where this is the case, the sponsoring entity has de facto control. A It is possible for an entity to be owned by a trust established for the benefit of employees without the entity controlling the trust. An example is when the entity is a co-operative, owned by its employees, and all of the shares are held in a trust for the benefit of the employees but the shares never vest in individual employees, with dividends from the company being distributed to employees solely in accordance with the provisions of the trust
