Reporting Requirements; FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland; FRS 103 Insurance Contracts; FRS 104 Interim Financial Reporting; and FRS 105 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable to the Micro-entities Regime. FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101 sets out an optional reduced disclosure framework which addresses the financial reporting requirements for individual financial statements of subsidiaries and ultimate parents that otherwise apply the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of adopted IFRS. Disclosure exemptions are available to a qualifying entity in its individual financial statements. FRS 101 was developed in response to concerns that arose from earlier consultations that a move to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard for subsidiaries of entities that apply EU-adopted IFRS would require recognition and measurement differences to be monitored and maintained at group level, and yet the alternative of a move to EU-adopted IFRS would increase disclosure in comparison to current accounting standards. A qualifying entity may apply the reduced disclosure framework regardless of the financial reporting framework applied in the consolidated financial statements of the group. Further details regarding the development of FRS 101 are set out in the Basis for Conclusions accompanying that FRS. FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland FRS 102 replaced accounting standards applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland with a single FRS developed from the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. FRS 102 applies to general purpose financial statements and the financial reporting of entities including those that are not constituted as companies and those that are not profit-oriented. FRS 102 applies to the financial statements of entities that are not applying adopted IFRS, FRS 101 or FRS 105. Further details on the development of FRS 102 are set
