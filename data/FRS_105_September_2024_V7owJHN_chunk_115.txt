obligation at the reporting date calculated using the methodology for selecting a discount rate in paragraph 23.11. The unwinding of the discount shall be recognised as interest expense in profit or loss in the period in which it arises. Termination benefits A micro-entity may be committed, by legislation, by contractual or other agreements with employees or their representatives or by a constructive obligation based on business practice, custom or a desire to act equitably, to make payments (or provide other benefits) to employees when it terminates their employment. Such payments are termination benefits. Recognition Because termination benefits do not provide a micro-entity with future economic benefits, a micro-entity shall recognise them as an expense in profit or loss immediately. A micro-entity shall recognise termination benefits as a liability and an expense only when the micro-entity is demonstrably committed either: to terminate the employment of an employee or group of employees before the normal retirement date; or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancy. A micro-entity is demonstrably committed to a termination only when the micro-entity has a detailed formal plan for the termination19 and is without realistic possibility of withdrawal from the plan. Measurement A micro-entity shall measure termination benefits at the best estimate of the expenditure that would be required to settle the obligation at the reporting date. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the measurement of termination benefits shall be based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. When termination benefits are due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period, they shall be measured at their discounted present value using the methodology for selecting a discount rate specified in paragraph 23.11.
