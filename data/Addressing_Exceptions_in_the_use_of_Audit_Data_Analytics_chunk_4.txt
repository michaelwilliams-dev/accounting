important consideration before using ADA is ensuring that it is an appropriate tool to generate audit evidence in the specific circumstances of an audit and also to consider where other, non-data analytics focused, tools and tests may be more appropriate. In determining if ADA is suitable for use in responding to identified risks, the auditor may wish to take account of the following considerations: If the use of ADA is not mandated by a firm’s methodology for the area being tested, whether making use of ADA would be the most effective method for collecting evidence. If the auditor’s understanding of the entity and its environment, how transactions are recorded and how balances relate to each other, is sufficient to allow for effective use of ADA. As part of this process, an understanding of the data flows within an entity and how data is managed and stored is likely to be beneficial in developing robust expectations. Whether the data being used to perform the ADA is of sufficient quality to support meaningful analysis. This will likely include ensuring that the data use is complete, accurate, valid, and accessible in a format which facilitates analysis. If the data is not of sufficient quality, whether there are data cleansing, or other processes that can be undertaken prior to its use in ADA. When undertaking data cleaning processes, auditors should be mindful that the processing of the data should be sufficient to allow for subsequent use but is not so extensive as to undermine the objective of the audit procedure for which the ADA is being used. Where some of the data in a set is of a poor quality but the rest is of an acceptable quality, for example if issues with an in-year system migration means that some months data is of
