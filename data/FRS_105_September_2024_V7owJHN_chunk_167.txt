This is because when there is a tax effect arising from the distribution, it affects taxable profits.

For example, they included: improving the consistency of the scope sections throughout the standard to make it clearer what is within and outside the scope of each section; removing defined terms from the main body of the standard to reduce its length, as defined terms are set out in Appendix I Glossary; and improving the consistency of terminology and language in some areas.
