definition of a micro-entity. Applicable accounting framework A3.7 Accounts prepared in accordance with FRS 105 are classified as ‘Companies Act individual accounts’ for the purposes of section 395 of the Act and are therefore required to comply with the applicable provisions of Parts 15 and 16 of the Act and with the Regulations referred to in paragraph A3.1. Fair value at initial recognition A3.8 The Small Companies (Micro-Entities’ Accounts) Regulations 2013 state that micro-entities are not permitted to apply the Alternative Accounting Rules or the Fair Value Rules as set out in company law. Therefore, micro-entities are only permitted to apply the Historical Cost Accounting Rules. A3.9 FRS 105 states that certain types of assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value at initial recognition, for example inventories acquired through a non-exchange transaction. This does not breach the prohibition against fair value accounting as this use of a fair value is a method of estimating cost at initial recognition. True and fair view A3.10 FRS 105 is an accounting standard and all accounting standards issued by the Financial Reporting Council are applicable to the preparation of financial statements that are intended to give a true and fair view. Financial statements of a micro-entity that include the minimum accounting items specified by The Small Companies (Micro-Entities’ Accounts) Regulations 2013 are presumed in law to give a true and fair view. The micro-entity minimum accounting items are set out in Section 3 Financial Statement Presentation, Section 4 Statement of Financial Position, Section 5 Income Statement and Section 6 Notes to the Financial Statements of this FRS.
