income, this need not necessarily be shown, although in those circumstances it would be good practice to add a footnote to confirm that there are no items of other comprehensive income. Credit Union A has chosen the single-statement approach to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

FRS 102 does not require use of the title Statement of Financial Position. Credit Union A has chosen to present its balance sheet in accordance with Schedule 2 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the Regulations). 8 This heading is not required by Schedule 2 to the Regulations. It has been included in order to group together the line items users might regard as ‘cash’. 9 It has been assumed that Credit Union A does not hold cash with the Bank of England. If there is no cash held with the Bank of England in either year presented, there is no need to include this line item. 10 The balance sheet should be signed by the secretary and two directors.
