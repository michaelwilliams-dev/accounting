from UK and Republic of Ireland stakeholders. Updating accounting requirements The most significant changes in the Periodic Review 2024 amendments were the introduction of fully-rewritten sections Section 20 Leases and Section 23 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In each case, the amendments were based on international accounting principles, modified where appropriate to make them suitable and proportionate for FRS 102 preparers.

Stakeholder feedback indicated that the standards, as amended by the Triennial Review 2017, are generally working well. There was no indication that stakeholders generally found the extant standards to be burdensome or were looking for reductions in the cost of applying them. Throughout FRS 102, some changes to drafting were made to provide incremental improvements and clarifications as a result of stakeholder feedback and matters identified by the FRC.
