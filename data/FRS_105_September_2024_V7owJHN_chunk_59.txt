of assets An item of property, plant or equipment or investment property may be acquired in exchange for a non-monetary asset or assets, or a combination of monetary and non-monetary assets. A micro-entity shall measure the cost of the acquired asset at fair value unless: the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance; or the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable. In that case, the assetâ€™s cost is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up. Subsequent measurement A micro-entity shall measure all items of property, plant and equipment and investment property after initial recognition at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. A micro-entity shall recognise the costs of day-to-day servicing of an item of property, plant and equipment or investment property in profit or loss in the period in which the costs are incurred. Depreciation If the major components of an item of property, plant and equipment or investment property have significantly different patterns of consumption of economic benefits, a micro-entity shall allocate the initial cost of the asset to its major components and depreciate each such component separately over its useful life. Other assets shall be depreciated over their useful lives as a single asset. There are some exceptions, such as land which generally has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not usually depreciated. The depreciation charge for each period shall be recognised in profit or loss unless another section of this FRS requires the cost to be recognised as part of the cost of an asset. For example, the depreciation of manufacturing property, plant and equipment is included in the costs of inventories (see Section 10 Inventories). Depreciable amount and depreciation period A micro-entity shall allocate the depreciable amount of an asset on
