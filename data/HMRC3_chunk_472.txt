than 12 months, you must deliver them to Companies House within 21 months of the date of incorporation, or 3 months from the accounting reference date - whichever is longer. Public companies If your first accounts cover a period of more than 12 months, you must deliver them to Companies House within 18 months of the date of incorporation, or 3 months from the accounting reference date - whichever is longer. Subsequent accounts In subsequent years, a private company or LLP has 9 months from the end of the accounting reference period to deliver its accounts. A public company has 6 months. However if you change the accounting reference period the filing time may be reduced. If you�re a director of the company, or designated member of the LLP - you�re personally responsible for delivering your accounts before the time allowed runs out. Delivery means actual receipt at Companies House in the correct format. A penalty is automatically imposed if the accounts are late. Late filing penalty fees The penalty only applies to accounts. The level of the penalty depends on how late the accounts reach Companies House.
