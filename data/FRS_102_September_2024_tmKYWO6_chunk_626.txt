assets to be measured at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell and their value in use. In a for-profit context, value in use is determined by measuring the present value of the cash flows derived from the asset. However, often PBE assets are held for their service potential rather than their ability to generate cash flows. In such a case it is sometimes impossible to determine value in use by reference to cash flows and it is more appropriate to regard value in use as the present value of future service potential. B27.2 IPSAS 21 Impairment of Non-Cash Generating Assets permits value in use to be determined by any of three approaches: depreciated replacement cost (DRC); restoration cost; or the service units approach. B27.3 Restoration cost and the service units approach are applications of DRC as DRC is used as the starting point. DRC reflects the cash outflows that are saved through ownership of an asset and is likely to be widely applicable and appropriate for PBEs. Therefore FRS 102 permits a service potential driven valuation to be used for assets held for their service potential. B27.4 The use of DRC is not mandated; other methods that value service potential rather than cash flows may be used if those methods are more appropriate in the particular circumstances. B27.5 Consideration was also given to whether a restriction on the use of an asset would affect its fair value. As an assetâ€™s fair value is based on the amount that an entity could obtain, restrictions might impact on the fair value when they prevent a purchaser from using the asset for another purpose that would be more valuable than that required by the restriction. In addition, the costs to sell should include the costs of breaking the restriction.
