subtotals in the statement of financial position and the statement(s) of financial performance become less informative. However, it could be appropriate to use more measurement bases if that is necessary to provide useful information. Verifiability is enhanced by using measurement bases that result in measures that can be independently corroborated either directly – for example, by observing prices – or indirectly – for example, by checking inputs to a model. If a measure cannot be verified, users of financial statements may need explanatory information to enable them to understand how the measure was determined. In some such cases, it may be necessary to specify the use of a different measurement basis. Measurement of equity The total carrying amount of equity (total equity) is not measured directly. It equals the total of the carrying amounts of all recognised assets less the total of the carrying amounts of all recognised liabilities. Although total equity is not measured directly, it may be appropriate to measure directly the carrying amount of some individual classes of equity and some components of equity. Presentation and disclosure Classification Classification is the sorting of assets, liabilities, equity, income or expenses on the basis of shared characteristics for presentation and disclosure purposes. Such characteristics include – but are not limited to – the nature of the item, its role (or function) within the business activities conducted by the entity, and how it is measured. Classifying dissimilar assets, liabilities, equity, income or expenses together can obscure relevant information, reduce understandability and comparability and may not provide a faithful representation of what it purports to represent. Classification is applied to the unit of account selected for an asset or liability. However, it may sometimes be appropriate to separate an asset or liability into components that have different characteristics and to classify
