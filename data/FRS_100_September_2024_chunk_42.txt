out in the Basis for Conclusions accompanying that FRS. FRS 103 Insurance Contracts FRS 103 and the accompanying non-mandatory implementation guidance consolidate existing financial reporting requirements and guidance for insurance contracts and are based on IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts extant in 2013 (except to the extent that it was amended by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement), the requirements of FRS 27 Life Assurance and elements of the Association of British Insurers’ Statement of Recommended Practice on Accounting for Insurance Business (the ABI SORP). An entity applying FRS 102, whether or not it is an insurance company, shall also apply FRS 103 to insurance contracts (including reinsurance contracts) that it issues and reinsurance contracts that it holds, and to other financial instruments that it issues with a discretionary participation feature. Further details on the development of FRS 103 are set out in the Basis for Conclusions accompanying that FRS. FRS 104 Interim Financial Reporting FRS 104 replaced the Statement Half-yearly financial reports. FRS 104 is based on the interim financial reporting requirements set out in IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and is intended for use in the preparation of interim reports by entities that apply FRS 102 when preparing their annual financial statements. Entities applying FRS 101 to prepare the annual financial statements may also use FRS 104 as a basis for their interim financial reports. FRS 104 does not require any entity to prepare an interim report, nor does it change the extent to which law or regulation may require the preparation of such a report. Further details on the development of FRS 104 are set out in the Basis for Conclusions accompanying that FRS.
