the right-of-use assets that relate to that class of property, plant and equipment. Subsequent measurement of the lease liability After the commencement date, a lessee shall measure the lease liability by: increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability; reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment (as set out in paragraphs 20.65 to 20.69) or lease modifications (as set out in paragraphs 20.70 to 20.73), or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments (see paragraph 20.52).

A lessee shall recognise the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. However, if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, a lessee shall recognise any remaining amount of the
