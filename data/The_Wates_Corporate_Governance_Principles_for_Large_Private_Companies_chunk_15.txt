also include processes for ensuring that new business opportunities of a certain value are considered and approved at board level. Risk A board has responsibility for an organisation’s overall approach to strategic decision-making and effective risk management (ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial), including reputational risk. This requires oversight of risk and how it is managed, and appropriate accountability to stakeholders. The size and nature of the business will determine the internal control systems put in place to manage and mitigate both emerging and principal risks.10 Some companies may decide to delegate to a committee to oversee such matters. 10 Description of principal risks is set out in the FRC’s Guidance on the Strategic Report. Responsibilities The board should establish an internal control framework with clearly deﬁned roles and responsibilities for those involved. It should agree an approach to reporting, including frequency of reporting and the points at which decisions are made and escalated. Responsibilities may include: developing appropriate risk management systems that identify emerging and established risks facing the company and its stakeholders. Such systems should enable the board to make informed and robust decisions, including those associated with material environmental, social and governance matters, such as climate change, workforce relationships, supply chains, and ethical considerations; determining the nature and extent of the principal risks faced and those risks which the organisation is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives (determining its ‘risk appetite’); agreeing how the principal risks should be managed or mitigated and over what timeframe to reduce the likelihood of their incidence or the magnitude of their impact; establishing clear internal and external communication channels on the identiﬁcation of risk factors, both internally and externally; and agreeing a monitoring and review process.
