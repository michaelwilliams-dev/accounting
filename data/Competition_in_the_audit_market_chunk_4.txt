team in the FRC’s Regulatory Standards Division but there is work across the FRC to improve the functioning of the audit market. Within the Regulatory Standards Division, there is work on audit policy and setting auditing standards. The Supervision Division leads on audit quality reviews, supervising audit firms, and conducting work on cross-market issues relating to audit quality and resilience, including the implementation of operational separation on a voluntary basis in the largest audit firms. The Enforcement Division conducts investigations and brings enforcement action to drive improvements in the market.
