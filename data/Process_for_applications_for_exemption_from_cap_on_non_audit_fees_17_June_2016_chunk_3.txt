exemption were allowed; and Whether any previous requests have been made by the applicant for this audited entity and, if so, what the outcomes were and why the issues given rise to the application and repeated application have not been resolved. FRC decision-making process Applications for exemption should be sent by the applicant to the Audit and Assurance Policy Team as soon as reasonably practicable. The Audit and Assurance Policy Team will take into account all information provided with the request and may seek further information from the applicant where it considers it necessary. The Audit and Assurance Policy Team will consider all requests and will make a recommendation to the Executive Director of Audit where it considers it has sufficient information. The Executive Director of Audit will consider the application and recommendation and make a decision. Where necessary, the Executive Director of Audit may request further information from the applicant, the Audit and Assurance Team or any other person (s)he considers appropriate prior to making a decision. The FRC will provide a decision to the applicant within 28 days of receipt of the request unless the applicant is informed otherwise. If the FRC allows an exemption, it will only allow the exemption for the minimum amount of time that it considers necessary in the circumstances. In cases where applicants granted an extension of less than two years make a further application to extend that initial exemption, the FRC will consider the further application on its own merits but will take into account the previous grant of an exemption. Reviews Applicants will be entitled to a review of a decision not to grant an exemption. Applications must be made within 14 days of the decision. Applicants will not be able to make more than one request for a review. The
