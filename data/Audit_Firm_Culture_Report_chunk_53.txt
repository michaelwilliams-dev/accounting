are brought into meetings (either physically or virtually) with the audited entity to observe challenge taking place. This is because it allows associates to see how these conversations are conducted, as well as feeling that partners are modelling and therefore encouraging these behaviours. “The best training is done on the job. One thing that's helped me is sitting in on those conversations [with the audited entity]” (Associate/Senior Associate) “On the job training is the most important bit… embedding that 'coaching culture’...You hear the theory in the classroom, but you actually get to deliver it on the job.” (Assistant manager/manager) Some directors and partners felt coaching is most effective when senior members of the team ‘lead by example’ internally as well as externally. In some cases, this is about facilitating internal challenge within audit teams (for example by telling auditors to ask questions of each other) so that junior auditors see this happening around them and feel more empowered to mirror those behaviours. For several partners, this was felt to work best when auditors are working in the same place or online space. By mixing job grades together in one environment, these partners feel that junior auditors are more likely to ‘learn by osmosis’, in particular, picking up on communication styles when more senior auditors are discussing challenge internally and when actually challenging clients during meetings. Using formal training to complement and embed exposure to desired auditor behaviours Despite this emphasis on informal training, learning on the job, and coaching over more formal means of training, formal training was also felt to have its place. Many junior and senior auditors felt that formal training delivered to associates (often aligned to qualification requirements) and new starters (typically delivered during onboarding) is effective in providing foundational understanding of scepticism and challenge because it:
