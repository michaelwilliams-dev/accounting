to complete and sell. This becomes the cost of the inventories at that date for application of this section. Techniques for measuring cost, such as standard costing, retail method and most recent purchase price A micro-entity may use techniques such as the standard cost method, the retail method or most recent purchase price for measuring the cost of inventories if the result approximates cost. Standard costs take into account normal levels of materials and supplies, labour, efficiency and capacity utilisation. They are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, revised in the light of current conditions. The retail method measures cost by reducing the sales value of the inventory by the appropriate percentage gross margin. Cost formulas A micro-entity shall measure the cost of inventories of items that are not ordinarily interchangeable and goods or services produced and segregated for specific projects by using specific identification of their individual costs. A micro-entity shall measure the cost of inventories, other than those dealt with in paragraph 10.16, by using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or weighted average cost formula. A micro-entity shall use the same cost formula for all inventories having a similar nature and use to the micro-entity. For inventories with a different nature or use, different cost formulas may be justified. The last-in, first-out method (LIFO) is not permitted by this FRS. Impairment of inventories Implicit in the requirement for a micro-entity to measure inventories at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete, is a requirement that a micro-entity shall assess at the end of each reporting period whether any inventories are impaired, ie the carrying amount is not fully recoverable (eg because of damage, obsolescence or declining selling prices). If an item (or group of items) of inventory is impaired, the micro-entity shall recognise an impairment
