items either in those statements or in the notes. An item that may not warrant separate presentation in those statements may warrant separate presentation in the notes. 3.16A When applying this FRS an entity shall decide, taking into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances, how it aggregates information in the financial statements, which includes the notes. An entity shall not reduce the understandability of its financial statements by obscuring material information with immaterial information or by aggregating material items that have different natures or functions. B This FRS specifies information that is required to be included in the financial statements, which includes the notes. An entity need not provide a specific disclosure required by this FRS if the information resulting from that disclosure is not material. This is the case even if this FRS contains a list of specific requirements or describes them as minimum requirements.34 Complete set of financial statements A complete set of financial statements of an entity shall include all of the following: a statement of financial position as at the reporting date; either: a single statement of comprehensive income for the reporting period displaying all items of income and expense recognised during the period including those items recognised in determining profit or loss (which is a subtotal in the statement of comprehensive income) and items of other comprehensive income; or a separate income statement and a separate statement of comprehensive income. If an entity chooses to present both an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income, the statement of comprehensive income begins with profit or loss and then displays the items of other comprehensive income; a statement of changes in equity for the reporting period; a statement of cash flows for the reporting period; and notes, comprising material accounting policy information and other explanatory information.
