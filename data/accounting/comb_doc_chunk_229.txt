Differences between FRS 102 and previous UK and Irish GAAP The tables below present the key accounting requirements in FRS 102 and previous UK and Irish GAAP for the most common types of financing transactions14, ie goods or services sold on deferred payment terms and loans made at a below market rate of interest. As highlighted below accounting differences may arise on transition to FRS 102 in some cases. The sale of goods or services on deferred payment terms FRS 4/ FRS 5|FRS 102| Borrower (purchaser of the goods/services on extended credit terms)| FRS 4 Capital instruments characterises a capital instrument as a means of raising finance. Where a transaction relates to a purchase on credit terms that is extended to the extent that there is a financing element to the transaction, the debt is recognised at the net proceeds, assumed to be the fair value of the goods or services received. The difference between the fair value and the amount to be paid is the finance cost, to be allocated to periods over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount. (FRS 4 paragraphs 27 and 28)|If the transaction is a financing transaction the financial liability shall be measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.
