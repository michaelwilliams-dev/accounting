jurisdiction and applied individually to the interim period pre-tax income of each jurisdiction. Similarly, if different income tax rates apply to different categories of income (such as capital gains or income earned in particular industries), to the extent practicable a separate rate is applied to each individual category of interim period pre-tax income. While that degree of precision is desirable, it may not be achievable in all cases, and a weighted average of rates across jurisdictions or across categories of income is used if it is a reasonable approximation of the effect of using more specific rates. A2.17 To illustrate the application of the foregoing principle, an entity reporting quarterly expects to earn Currency Units (CU)10,000 pre-tax each quarter and operates in a jurisdiction with a tax rate of 20% on the first CU20,000 of annual earnings and 30% on all additional earnings. Actual earnings match expectations. The following table shows the amount of income tax expense that is reported in each quarter: |1st Quarter|2nd Quarter|3rd Quarter|4th Quarter|Annual| Tax expense|CU2,500|CU2,500|CU2,500|CU2,500|CU10,000| CU10,000 of tax is expected to be payable for the full year on CU40,000 of pre-tax income. A2.18 As another illustration, an entity reports quarterly, earns CU15,000 pre-tax profit in the first quarter but expects to incur losses of CU5,000 in each of the three remaining quarters (thus having zero income for the year), and operates in a jurisdiction in which its estimated average annual income tax rate is expected to be 20%. The following table shows the amount of income tax expense that is reported in each quarter: |1st Quarter|2nd Quarter|3rd Quarter|4th Quarter|Annual| Tax expense|CU3,000|CU(1,000)|CU(1,000)|CU(1,000)|nil| Difference in financial reporting year and tax year A2.19 If the financial reporting year and the income tax year differ, income tax expense for the interim periods of that financial reporting year is measured
