of another entity. [Deleted] Basic financial instruments within the scope of Section 11 are those that satisfy the conditions in paragraph 11.8. Examples of financial instruments that normally satisfy those conditions include: cash; demand and fixed-term deposits when the entity is the depositor, eg bank accounts; commercial paper and commercial bills held; accounts, notes and loans receivable and payable; bonds and similar debt instruments; investments in non-derivative financial instruments that are equity of the issuer (eg most ordinary shares and certain preference shares); and commitments to receive a loan and commitments to make a loan to another entity that meet the conditions of paragraph 11.8(c). Examples of financial instruments that do not normally satisfy the conditions in paragraph 11.8, and are therefore within the scope of Section 12, include: asset-backed securities, such as collateralised mortgage obligations, repurchase agreements and securitised packages of receivables; derivatives, eg options, rights, warrants, futures contracts, forward contracts and interest rate swaps; financial instruments that qualify and are designated as hedging instruments in accordance with the requirements in Section 12; and commitments to make a loan to another entity and commitments to receive a loan, if the commitment can be settled net in cash. [Deleted] A The initial classification of a financial instrument shall take into account contractual terms including those relating to future variations. Once the classification of a financial instrument is determined at initial recognition, re-assessment is only required subsequently when there has been a modification of contractual terms that is relevant to an assessment of the classification. Scope of Section 11 This section applies to all financial instruments meeting the conditions of paragraph 11.8 except for: Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures (see Sections 9 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, 14 Investments in Associates and 15 Investments in Joint Ventures).
