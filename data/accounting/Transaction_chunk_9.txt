cannot be processed by the Transaction Engine. This may include syntax checks on the entire GovTalkMessage. This message can be returned by the Transaction Engine for a number of reasons: An invalid document is submitted that fails DSP schema/protocol validation The Transaction Engine has been disabled for scheduled downtime of a back-end system – an internal error. � The back-end system does not respond in a timely manner. � For example, as illustrated, the initial SUBMISSION_REQUEST may be missing the Class element, or a SUBMISSION_POLL may be missing a CorrelationID. Either of these errors is classed as fatal since the Transaction Engine does not have sufficient information to process the message. In this case, the Transaction Engine will return a SUBMISSION_ERROR message with an Error/Type of fatal. The behaviour of the client system depends on the point at which the error occurred. If the error occurred on a SUBMISSION_REQUEST, the client should correct the error and resubmit the message. If it occurs later in the sequence, the client application must continue the sequence using the value of CorrelationID from the original SUBMISSION_RESPONSE. Note: the DATA_REQUEST verb can be used to identify those submission sequences that have not completed successfully. Message Structure GovTalkMessage|MANDATORY.
