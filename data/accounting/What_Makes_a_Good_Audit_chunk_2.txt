what does a good audit look like? This paper sets out our views of the key elements that make up a good audit as a contribution to the debate within audit firms of how they should improve audit quality. As our inspections work has consistently demonstrated, standards of audit quality in the UK are not acceptable, with just 71% of inspected audits meeting the relevant standards.

This paper sets out these nine elements, highlighting best practice we have seen in each. We also recognise that auditing requires the application of judgement within a principles-based framework. It is not just a rules-based
