Guidance Submit a contracted work and administration (CWA) claim online How CWA works online: how to claim, bulkloading, outcomes, new matter starts and guidance. From: Legal Aid Agency (/government/organisations/legal-aid-agency) Published 1 June 2014 Last updated 6 January 2025 — How to claim All claims for controlled work must be submitted via CWA. CWA is a digital billing service that contains all providers’ contracts and schedules. It’s used to make claiming simpler and more efficient, eg allows and validates monthly submissions online and calculates fees. To access CWA, log in to LAA online (https://portal.legalservices.gov.uk/LAAPortal/pages/home.jsp). How CWA works All contracted provider offices are set up in CWA on the LAA portal with at least 1 person registered to use the service. That user can go on to create other users. To create a new user, see ‘add and edit users’ in the CWA quick guides (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cwa-quick-g uides). Bulkloading If you want to bulkload your outcomes, remember to add the schedule and account numbers to your file. If you don’t want to bulkload your data, the submission list will display your current submission period where you can update it and go to step 1 of the submission process. Using the bulkload spreadsheet and compatibility If your case management system isn’t compatible with CWA, you can still bulkload your submission data using the [ and Bulkload spreadsheet guide (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a82c76aed915d74e623796e/bulkload- spreadsheet-g uidance.pdf) (PDF, 814 KB, 27 pages). You can find answers to most questions in the CWA quick guides (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cwa-quick-g uides). In light of the changes to LAA online and the Provider bulkload spreadsheet (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/677bc6906f01ae28ab5c03ec/Provider_Bulklo ad_Spreadsheet.xls) (MS Excel Spreadsheet, 9.99 MB), the Civil amendment request form (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c926441e5274a29a357008d/Civil_CWA_Am endment_Request_Form.xls) (MS Excel Spreadsheet, 174 KB) has been updated to reflect the new fields in CWA. Can all providers please start to use the new spreadsheets with immediate
