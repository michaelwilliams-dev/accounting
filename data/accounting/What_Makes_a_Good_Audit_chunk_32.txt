audit methodology; and Supports the audit team in meeting the requirements in ISAs (UK) but in a way that does not detract from critical thinking and professional scepticism. Allows scalability of the audit approach through functionality and tailoring of audit procedures. Information and communication Supporting the culture of high-quality in audit necessitates a significant investment in training of people in the audit practice that is supported by high-quality information and communication over relevant matters auditors need to know and actions that auditors need to take. The firms that we review have extensive information that is made available to auditors in a variety of ways, systems and formats. Firms regularly communicate with their auditors and look to ensure that their staff have appropriate knowledge and skills for their roles. This is supported by access to central teams with in-depth knowledge over auditing, accounting and other relevant matters. All of the firms we review on an annual basis have well established training courses and training material. The importance of this training is clear to the firms. Historically training has been biased towards technical training but there is a shift towards including soft skills and critical thinking training to assist with critical areas such as challenge of management and the audit of key judgements. There continue to be several findings from the various FRC reviews undertaken that suggests that firms need to periodically reassess the scope and depth of training in these critical areas. As firms transition to the more formal quality-driven approach under ISQM (UK) 1 the feedback to training and communication will need further consideration. A high-quality audit practice will also have a high degree of open and candid engagement with the regulator on significant issues. This includes making sure there are robust and effective plans in place to improve audit
