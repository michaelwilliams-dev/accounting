from non-lease components of the contract, unless the entity applies the practical expedient in paragraph 20.33. The right to use an underlying asset is a separate lease component if the lessee can benefit from use of the underlying asset on its own or together with other readily available resources, and the underlying asset is neither highly dependent on nor highly interrelated with the other underlying assets in the contract. Amounts payable by the lessee under a contract for activities or costs that do not transfer a good or service to the lessee do not give rise to a separate component but form part of the total consideration to be allocated to the components of the contract. Lessee For a contract that contains one or more lease components and one or more non-lease components, a lessee shall allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components. The relative stand-alone price of lease and non-lease components shall be determined on the basis of the price the lessor, or a similar supplier, would charge an entity for that component, or a similar component, separately. If an observable stand-alone price is not readily available, the lessee shall estimate the stand-alone price, maximising the use of observable information. As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect, by class of underlying asset, not to separate non-lease components from lease components, and instead account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease component. Unless the practical expedient in paragraph 20.33 is applied, a lessee shall account for non-lease components by applying other sections of this FRS. A lessor may provide a lessee with incoming resources from a government grant or,
