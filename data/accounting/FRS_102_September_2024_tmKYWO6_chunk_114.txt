statement of comprehensive income if presented), in a column identified as relating to discontinued operations, ie separately from continuing operations; a total column shall also be presented. F An entity shall re-present the disclosures in paragraph 5.7E for prior periods presented in the financial statements so that the disclosures relate to all operations that have been discontinued by the end of the reporting period for the latest period presented. An entity shall recognise all items of income or expense in a period in profit or loss unless an FRS requires or permits otherwise, or unless prohibited by the Act. For example, under this FRS, the effects of corrections of material errors and changes in accounting policies are presented as retrospective adjustments of prior periods rather than as part of profit or loss in the period in which they arise (see Section 10). An entity shall present additional line items, headings and subtotals in the statement of comprehensive income (and in the income statement, if presented), when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the entity’s financial performance. * 5.9A When items included in total comprehensive income are material, an entity shall disclose their nature and amount separately, in the statement of comprehensive income (and in the income statement, if presented) or in the notes. B This FRS does not require disclosure of ‘operating profit’. However, if an entity elects to disclose operating profit the entity should ensure that the amount disclosed is representative of activities that would normally be regarded as ‘operating’. For example, it would be inappropriate to exclude items clearly related to operations (such as inventory write-downs, profits or losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment, investment property and intangible assets, and restructuring and relocation expenses) because they occur irregularly or infrequently or are unusual
