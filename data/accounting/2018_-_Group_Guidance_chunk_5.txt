Where there are no matters to discuss, rather than requiring the EQCR to dilute the focus of their review, by holding a series of discussions for compliance purposes only, they might instead conclude that in 8 See paragraph 26 of ISA (UK) 600. 9 See paragraph 27(b) of ISA (UK) 600. 10 See paragraph 36R-1 of ISQC (UK) 1. 11 See paragraph 21R-1 of ISA (UK) 220 (Revised June 2016) Quality Control For An Audit Of Financial Statements. 12 See paragraph 21R-2 of ISA (UK) 220. certain circumstances a discussion is not required.
