queries logging, issue- raising and follow-up and providing feedback. Firms should make use of appropriate technology to facilitate effective collaboration and communication throughout the audit, including between UK and ODC teams and, where appropriate, with the audited entity. There should be comprehensive internal accreditation programmes with accreditation levels maintained within the ODC staff booking system. This would provide information to the onshore teams to allow them to select staff from the ODCs with appropriate skills, experience, and accreditation to book on the audit. Use of people engagement initiatives to bridge any communications gap between ODCs and onshore teams. It is useful to set up a network of ODC champions at the UK firm to provide on-the-ground support to onshore audit engagement teams on using ODCs effectively in the delivery of audits. Firms should define and agree communication methods between the UK and offshore teams at the start of the audit. Firms should seek to further enhance integration between the UK and offshore practice through in person visits, for example through onshore leaders and team members visiting the offshore location regularly and offshore team members attending training events in the UK or undertaking secondments to the UK firm. This is important for team members to feel part of the same team and understand ways of working, increasing efficiency and knowledge. Consideration of cultural alignment between the ODC and the UK firm. Embedding and incentivising the UK audit practice’s core values and behaviours at the ODCs to support delivery of high-quality audits, in particular the importance of professional scepticism and challenge of management. This should include the UK firm having insight and input into how ODC staff are appraised, remunerated and promoted. Effective controls over information security, ensuring that UK firm’s data continues to be protected against loss, damage and malicious acts.
