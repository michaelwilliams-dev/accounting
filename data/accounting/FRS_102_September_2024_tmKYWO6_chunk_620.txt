modifications when an entity applies the Periodic Review 2024 amendments for the first time (paragraphs 1.62 and 1.65) or when an entity adopts FRS 102 for the first time (paragraph 35.10(y)). B23.10 The FRC also concluded that the disclosure requirements in Section 23 should be based on those in IASB/ED/2022/1 rather than IFRS 15 to provide proportionate and practical solutions that are cost effective to apply. The FRC will also consider whether the disclosure requirements are delivering their intent at the next periodic review. B23.11 Some respondents noted that IFRS 15 required disclosure of significant judgements made in applying the standard, and that equivalent requirements did not appear in Section 23. The FRC notes that Section 8, and paragraph 8.6 in particular, would also apply to the judgements applied in respect of Section 23. Transition B23.12 Transitional requirements allow entities to apply the revised Section 23 retrospectively in accordance with Section 10 Accounting Policies, Estimates and Errors, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the revised section recognised in the current year. The latter approach is similar to the ‘cumulative catch-up’ transition method in IFRS 15, but as a proportionate simplification also allows greater scope to use hindsight when estimating variable consideration and evaluating contract modifications on transition. B24 Section 24 Government Grants Performance model and accrual model B24.1 A number of respondents, particularly from the public benefit entity sector, raised concerns about the proposed changes to the recognition of income from grants when an entity fulfilled the performance criteria stipulated in the grant (the performance model). This would have been a change from both previous accounting standards and EU-adopted IFRS, which both attempt to match grant income with the related expenditure (the accruals model). B24.2 The performance model could have been supplemented with additional application guidance on
