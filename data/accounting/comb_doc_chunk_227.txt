(paragraph 11.14(a) of FRS 102). This requirement applies regardless of whether the financial asset or financial liability results from an arrangement that constitutes a financing transaction or not. The effective interest rate is determined in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs 11.16 to 11.20 of FRS 102. Assuming that the original effective interest rate as determined at the time of the initial recognition of the loan is a fixed rate of interest, the rate is not updated for subsequent changes to the market rate of interest. The following numerical example demonstrates the subsequent accounting for an interest-free loan. Example 6: Subsequent measurement of interest-free loans On 1 January 20X1 a subsidiary obtains an interest-free loan of CU1,000 from its parent. The loan is repayable in full on 31 December 20X2. The market rate of interest for similar loans is 5.4 per cent per annum. The net present value of the loan is CU90012 (1,000/1.0542=900). The amortised cost of the loan as at 31 December 20X1 and 20X2 is as follows: Year|Carrying amount at 1 January CU|Interest accrued (5.4%) CU|Cash flow CU|Carrying amount at 31 December CU| 20X1|900|49|—|949| 20X2|949|51|(1,000)|—| On 1 January 20X1 the parent and the subsidiary would record the accounting entries set out in Example 2 above when a parent makes an interest-free loan to its subsidiary. As described in Example 2, at initial recognition the interest-free loan is accounted for as a loan at a market- rate of interest and a capital contribution or distribution. After initial recognition the interest- free loan is treated for accounting purpose as if it was a loan at a market rate of interest with capital and interest payable at the end of the term of the loan. Interest is accounted for applying the effective interest method. The entity receiving interest (in this
