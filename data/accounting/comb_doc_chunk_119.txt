(FRS 102 paragraph 16.2) A property interest that is held by a lessee under an operating lease may be classified and accounted for as investment property. (FRS 102 paragraph 16.3) Property that has a mixed use will be separated into investment property and property, plant and equipment.

SSAP 19 is not explicit on this point, therefore this may constitute a change when applying FRS 102. There is no requirement to separate mixed-use properties under SSAP 19, although this may occur in practice, in which case no change would be required on application of FRS 102.
