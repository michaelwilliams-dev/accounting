to be the same as the cash flows. FRS 102 paragraph 7.15 gives a choice for interest paid and received to be included in operating cash flows or in financing and investing respectively. Here the choice has been taken to include interest paid in operating cash flows and interest received in investing cash flows. 7 For simplicity, the taxation charge in this example is assumed to be the same as the cash flows. 8 The ‘cash from operations’ subtotal is discretionary and is used here in part to illustrate the similarity between the two cash flow statements. 9 FRS 102 paragraph 7.16 gives a choice for dividends paid to be included either in cash flows arising from operating activities or financing activities. 10 Overdrafts have been included within this opening figure as the overdraft is repayable on demand and forms an integral part of the entity’s cash management (see paragraph 7.2 of FRS 102). 11 It is assumed that the ‘current asset investments’ shown as liquid resources in the first example have a short maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition, are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and hence in the FRS 102 cash flow statement are included as part of cash and cash equivalents. 12 This reconciliation shall be given either adjoining the cash flow statement or in a note as it is here (FRS 1 paragraph 33). 13 FRS 102 paragraph 7.20 requires an entity to present the components of cash and cash equivalents. It also requires a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents as presented in the cash flow statement to the equivalent items presented in the statement of financial position (balance sheet). In addition, paragraph 7.21 of FRS 102
