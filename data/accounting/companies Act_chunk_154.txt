of subsection (2), the person— purports to act as director, or acts as shadow director.] [ If it appears to the registrar that, as a result of subsection (2), a company should have F156(3) given notice under section 167G of a person having ceased to be a director but has failed to do so, the registrar must include a note in the register recording that fact.]] Minimum age for appointment as director A person may not be appointed a director of a company unless he has attained the age of 16 years. This does not affect the validity of an appointment that is not to take effect until the person appointed attains that age. Where the office of director of a company is held by a corporation sole, or otherwise by virtue of another office, the appointment to that other office of a person who has not attained the age of 16 years is not effective also to make him a director of the company until he attains the age of 16 years. An appointment made in contravention of this section is void. Nothing in this section affects any liability of a person under any provision of the Companies Acts if he— purports to act as director, or acts as a shadow director, although he could not, by virtue of this section, be validly appointed as a director. This section has effect subject to section 158 (power to provide for exceptions from minimum age requirement). Power to provide for exceptions from minimum age requirement The Secretary of State may make provision by regulations for cases in which a person who has not attained the age of 16 years may be appointed a director of a company.
