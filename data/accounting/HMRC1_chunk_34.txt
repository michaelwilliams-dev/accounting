next accounting period. Example The opening balance in your main pool is �9,000. You buy a machine worth �1,200. The total for this pool is then �10,200 (�9,000 plus �1,200). You sell a desk for �200. The total for this pool is then �10,000 (�10,200 minus �200). Apply the rate for the main pool (18%). The amount you can claim for this pool in this period is �1,800 (18% of �10,000). The rest (�8,200) is your closing balance or tax written down value. This is carried over and becomes your opening balance in this pool for your next accounting period. Items you use outside your business For items that are in a single asset pool because you�ve used them outside your business, reduce the amount you can claim by the amount you use them privately. You still deduct the full amount from your pool to get the closing balance. Example You have a single asset pool for a car that qualifies for the main rate (18%). The opening balance is �10,000. You use the car for your family for half the time. If you did not use it outside your business, you could�ve claimed �1,800 (18% of �10,000) for the car. Because you use it for your family half the time, you can only claim �900 (half of �1,800). You still deduct the full amount of capital allowances (�1,800) from your balance - even though you can only claim half of them (�900) on your tax return. The closing balance in this pool is �8,200 (�10,000 minus �1,800). This is the starting balance for the next year. Items you use privately that are not in a single asset pool If you start using something outside your business that you�ve already claimed capital allowances on: add the market value of the
