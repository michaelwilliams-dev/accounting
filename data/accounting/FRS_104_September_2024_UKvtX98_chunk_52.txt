This included amending the references to ‘EU-adopted IFRS’ to read ‘adopted IFRS’, which incorporates the accounting standards referred to in both UK and Irish company law (UK-adopted international accounting standards and EU-adopted IFRS, respectively). Periodic Review 2024 In March 2024, the FRC issued Amendments to FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland and other FRSs – Periodic Review 2024, which made consequential amendments to this FRS to reflect the amendments made to FRS 102. 6 This reflects the standards referenced in UK company law at the time, prior to the UK exit from the European Union (see paragraph 20 of this Basis for Conclusions).
