those provisions, the entity shall give a brief description of how the financial statements depart from the recommended practice set out in the SORP, which shall include: for any treatment that is not in accordance with the SORP, the reasons why the treatment adopted is judged more appropriate to the entity's particular circumstances; and brief details of any disclosures recommended by the SORP that have not been provided, and the reasons why they have not been provided. A small entity in the Republic of Ireland applying the small entities regime in FRS 102 is encouraged to provide these disclosures. SORPs recommend particular accounting treatments and disclosures with the aim of narrowing areas of difference and variety between comparable entities. Compliance with a SORP that has been generally accepted by an industry or sector leads to enhanced comparability between the financial statements of entities in that industry or sector. Comparability is further enhanced if users are made aware of the extent to which an entity complies with a SORP, and the reasons for any departures. The effect of a departure from a SORP need not be quantified, except in those rare cases where such quantification is necessary for the entity's financial statements to give a true and fair view. Entities whose financial statements do not fall within the scope of a SORP may, if the SORP is otherwise relevant to them, nevertheless choose to comply with the SORP's recommendations when preparing financial statements, provided that the SORP does not conflict with the requirements of the framework adopted. Where this is the case, entities are encouraged to disclose that fact. Statement of compliance When an entity prepares its financial statements in accordance with FRS 101 or FRS 102, it shall include a statement of compliance in the notes to the financial statements
