shall allocate that discount or amount of variable consideration using a method that reflects such an amount (eg a variable payment may be allocated entirely to one performance obligation in the contract if the terms of that variable payment relate specifically to the entity’s efforts to satisfy that performance obligation). Step 5 – Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation A micro-entity shall recognise revenue when (or as) the micro-entity satisfies a promise to transfer a good or service or bundle of goods or services to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. For each performance obligation identified, a micro-entity shall determine at contract inception whether the performance obligation is satisfied over time (in accordance with paragraphs 18.37 to 18.38) or satisfied at a point in time (in accordance with paragraphs 18.39 to 18.40). Goods and services are assets, even if only momentarily, when they are received and used (as in the case of many services). Control of an asset refers to the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining economic benefits that may flow from, the asset. Performance obligations satisfied over time A micro-entity transfers control of a good or service over time, and therefore satisfies a performance obligation over time, if one of the following criteria is met: the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the micro-entity’s performance as the micro-entity performs (eg routine or recurring services such as a cleaning service). If a micro-entity cannot readily identify whether this is the case, a performance obligation is satisfied over time if another entity would not need to substantially re-perform the work that the micro-entity has completed to date if that other entity
