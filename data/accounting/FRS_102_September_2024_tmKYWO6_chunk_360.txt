as consideration for the share-based payments have been received. In this case, on grant date the entity shall recognise the services received in full, with a corresponding increase in equity or liabilities. If the share-based payments do not vest until the counterparty completes a specified period of service, the entity shall presume that the services to be rendered by the counterparty as consideration for those share-based payments will be received in the future, during the vesting period. The entity shall account for those services as they are rendered by the counterparty during the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity or liabilities. Measurement of equity-settled share-based payment transactions Measurement principle For equity-settled share-based payment transactions, an entity shall measure the goods or services received, and the corresponding increase in equity, at the fair value of the goods or services received, unless that fair value cannot be estimated reliably. If the entity cannot estimate reliably the fair value of the goods or services received, the entity shall measure their value, and the corresponding increase in equity, by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted measured in accordance with paragraphs 26.10 and 26.11. To apply this requirement to transactions with employees and others providing similar services, the entity shall measure the fair value of the services received by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted, because typically it is not possible to estimate reliably the fair value of the services received. For transactions with employees (including others providing similar services), the fair value of the equity instruments shall be measured at grant date. For transactions with parties other than employees, the measurement date is the date when the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service. A grant of equity instruments might be conditional
