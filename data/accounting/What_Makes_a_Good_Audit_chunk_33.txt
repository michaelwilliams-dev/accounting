quality and regular reporting of progress internally (and to the regulator) on delivering against such plans. What we have seen – Information and communication We noted from our review of some firms root cause analysis that the scope of training is changing to include critical thinking and softer skills on dealing with challenge. As part of our review of audit methodology and training, we identified several areas of good practice: “The firm provides extensive experienced hire training that includes scenarios and case studies to prepare the individual for their new role.” “The firm mandates training at the milestone of becoming a manager and on completion of one year in the role. This training is a good addition to the annual update training provided to all qualified auditors.” “The firm achieves a very high completion rate for mandatory training and has clear consequences for individuals that do not attend, including a process for identifying repeat offenders.“ “An analysis of post course assessment results to identify difficult topics: the firm has a process to analyse how often individual questions are answered incorrectly to identify topics that course attendees found difficult.“ “Monitoring the number of attempts an individual takes to pass a post course assessment: the firm monitors the number of attempts an individual takes to complete post course assessments. When the number exceeds a pre-set threshold an action plan is agreed with the individual and monitored.” “The frequency and quality of ongoing communications to partners and staff on methodology and guidance: the firm regularly issues guidance on new auditing and accounting standards and refreshers on existing standards that are of a high standard.” Financial Reporting Council 8th Floor 125 London Wall London EC2Y 5AS +44 (0)20 7492 2300 www.frc.org.uk
