FRS 102 does not appear to give rise to any legal conflicts for Societies. However, Societies often carry out activities that are regulated and may be required to comply with additional regulations on top of the legal requirements and accounting standards. Some Societies fall within the scope of SORPs, which reflect the requirements of FRS 102.| Friendly Societies Act 1992|Every society shall prepare a balance sheet and an income and expenditure account for each financial year giving a true and fair view of the affairs of the society and its income and expenditure for the year. The Friendly Societies (Accounts and Related Provisions) Regulations 1994 make further requirements about the form and content of friendly society accounts, which do not appear inconsistent with the requirements of FRS 102.| The Occupational Pension Schemes (Requirement to obtain Audited Accounts and a Statement from the Auditor) Regulations 1996|The accounts of pension funds within the scope of the regulations should show a true and fair view of the transactions during the year, assets held at the end of the year and liabilities of the scheme, other than those to pay pensions and benefits. FRS 102 includes retirement benefit plans as a specialised activity.| Appendix III Republic of Ireland
