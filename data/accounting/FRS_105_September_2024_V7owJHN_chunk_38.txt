use its judgement in developing and applying an accounting policy that results in information that: represents faithfully the transactions, other events or conditions; reflects the economic substance of the transactions, other events and conditions, and not merely the legal form; is neutral, ie free from bias; and is prudent. In making the judgement described in paragraph 8.4, management shall refer to and consider the definitions, recognition criteria and measurement concepts for assets, liabilities, income and expenses and the pervasive principles in Section 2 Concepts and Pervasive Principles. A micro-entity is not required to provide any disclosures other than those required by Section 6 Notes to the Financial Statements in respect of these transactions or events. Consistency of accounting policies A micro-entity shall select and apply its accounting policies consistently for similar transactions, other events and conditions. Changes in accounting policies A micro-entity shall change an accounting policy only if the change: is required by this FRS; or results in the financial statements providing reliable and more relevant information about the effects of transactions, other events or conditions on the micro-entityâ€™s financial position and financial performance. The following are not changes in accounting policies: the application of an accounting policy for transactions, other events or conditions that differ in substance from those previously occurring; and the application of a new accounting policy for transactions, other events or conditions that did not occur previously or were not material. Applying changes in accounting policies A micro-entity shall account for changes in accounting policy as follows: a micro-entity shall account for a change in accounting policy resulting from a change in the requirements of this FRS in accordance with the transitional provisions, if any, specified in that amendment; and a micro-entity shall account for all other changes in accounting policy retrospectively (see paragraph 8.10).
