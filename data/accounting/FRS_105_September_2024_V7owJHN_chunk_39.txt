Retrospective application When a change in accounting policy is applied retrospectively in accordance with paragraph 8.9, the micro-entity shall apply the new accounting policy to comparative information for prior periods to the earliest date for which it is practicable, as if the new accounting policy had always been applied. When it is impracticable to determine the individual period effects of a change in accounting policy on comparative information for one or more prior periods presented, the micro-entity shall apply the new accounting policy to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as at the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable, which may be the current period, and shall make a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of each affected component of equity for that period. Disclosures 8.10A An Irish micro-entity shall disclose information in relation to changes to accounting policies and corrections of material prior period errors in accordance with Appendix B to Section 6. Accounting estimates 8.10B An accounting policy may require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty â€“ that is, the accounting policy may require such items to be measured at monetary amounts that cannot be observed directly and must instead be estimated. In such a case, a micro-entity develops an accounting estimate to achieve the objective set out by the accounting policy. Developing accounting estimates involves the use of judgements or assumptions based on the latest available, reliable information. C A micro-entity uses measurement techniques and inputs to develop an accounting estimate. Measurement techniques include estimation techniques and valuation techniques. The effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates unless they result from the correction of prior period errors.
