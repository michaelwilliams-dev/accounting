Paying online by Direct Debit Set up a Direct Debit through your HMRC online account (https://www.access.service.gov.uk/login/signin/creds). You’ll need the Government Gateway user ID and password you used when you registered for the account. The Direct Debit will not collect return payments over £20 million. If you owe more, you will need to pay another way. You should set up the Direct Debit at least 5 working days before the date you want your payment to be collected. You can only use this service if you’re registered for one or more of the following services: Self Assessment online PAYE for employers Corporation Tax online CIS online Machine Games Duty online Paying by debit or corporate credit card You can make a full payment online using a debit or corporate credit card. There is a non-refundable fee if you use a corporate credit or debit card. You cannot pay by personal credit card. Your payment will be accepted on the date you make it and not the date it reaches HMRC’s account (including weekends and bank holidays). You must make sure the details you enter match those held by your bank or card provider. For example, the billing address should match the one your card is currently registered with. Pay by bank transfer If you pay by CHAPS (Clearing House Automated Payment System) or Faster Payments, you can submit your payment on the same or next day. If you pay by Bacs (Bankers Automated Clearing System), allow 3 working days for the payment to reach HMRC. We recommend you check your bank’s processing times and maximum transaction limits before you pay. Account details to use if your account is in the UK Use the following details to
