If you are unhappy with their response you should complain to their professional body, if they have one. How can I complain to their professional body? To find out if the accountant or actuary is a member of a professional body check their website, or any letters received from them. Alternatively, you can search online: Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) Chartered Accountants Ireland (CAI) Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) Institute of Chartered Accountants Scotland (ICAS) Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA) You can then complain to the relevant professional body and details can be found on their websites.

If the accountant or actuary is not a member of one of the bodies we oversee you should then ask the accountant, actuary or firm if they are a member of another body you can complain to.
