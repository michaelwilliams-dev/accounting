subsequent accounting for an interest-free loan. 12 In accordance with paragraph 22.17 of FRS 102 a distribution is recorded as a reduction of equity. A distribution recorded in the financial statements in accordance with FRS 102 may not be a distribution as a matter of law. The legal requirements on distributable profits are not addressed in this factsheet. Technical Release 02/17BL considers issues concerning the determination of distributable profits and entities may refer to this or any successor document for more guidance. Appendixâ€”Financing transactions Subsequent measurement Basic financial assets and financial liabilities are generally measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method (paragraph 11.14(a) of FRS 102). This requirement applies regardless of whether the financial asset or financial liability results from an arrangement that constitutes a financing transaction or not. The effective interest rate is determined in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs 11.16 to 11.20 of FRS 102. Assuming that the original effective interest rate as determined at the time of the initial recognition of the loan is a fixed rate of interest, the rate is not updated for subsequent changes to the market rate of interest. The following numerical example demonstrates the subsequent accounting for an interest-free loan. Example 6: Subsequent measurement of interest-free loans On 1 January 20X1 a subsidiary obtains an interest-free loan of CU1,000 from its parent. The loan is repayable in full on 31 December 20X2. The market rate of interest for similar loans is 5.4 per cent per annum. The net present value of the loan is CU90013 (1,000/1.0542=900). The amortised cost of the loan as at 31 December 20X1 and 20X2 is as follows: Year|Carrying amount at 1 January|Interest accrued (5.4%)|Cash flow|Carrying amount at 31 December| |CU|CU|CU|CU| 20X1|900|49|-|949| 20X2|949|51|(1,000)|-| On 1 January 20X1 the parent and the subsidiary would record the
