filed on time. But if there�s a special reason why the accounts might be filed late (such as an unforeseen event), you can apply for more time to file your accounts if your filing deadline has not passed. An extension will only be granted if the reasons are exceptional. When accounts are incorrect We cannot accept accounts until they meet the requirements of the Companies Act. For example, if the balance sheet is not signed, we�ll return the accounts for amendment. But if you file the corrected accounts late, the company will get a late filing penalty. To avoid this, you should deliver accounts as soon as they�re complete, and as early as possible before the last date for delivery. Knowing when a penalty has been imposed If you deliver your accounts late, we�ll automatically issue a penalty notice to the registered o?ce address. The penalty notice gives details of the penalty (or penalties) imposed against the company. It shows the last date for filing, the date your accounts were filed and the level of the penalty imposed. Paying your penalty If your late filing penalty occurred on or after 30 March 2020, you may be able to pay y our late filing penalty online. You will find a link to the online service on your penalty notice. If you do not pay the penalty, we�ll ask our debt collectors to take action. Ultimately the matter will be decided in the County Court or Sheri? Court, where you�ll have the opportunity to file a defence. You may consider getting professional advice. We may seek to recover our legal costs if the court finds in favour of the registrar. Requesting payment by instalments If you have di?culty paying the penalty, we�ll normally accept payment over a short period by monthly instalments.
