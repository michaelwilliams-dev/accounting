APPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE THE START OF AN AUDIT ENGAGEMENT PERIOD IN CASES OF UNCERTAINTY Article 17(8) of EU Audit Regulation (EU 537/2014) states that an audit firm must immediately report any uncertainty as to the start date of the audit engagement ('the relevant date') to the Competent Authority and that the Competent Authority shall ultimately determine the relevant date. In that the issue is also likely to be of significant importance to public interest entities themselves, the FRC will consider requests by such entities to determine the start of an audit engagement period in cases of uncertainty. Where the FRC determines the start date for an audit engagement period, the FRC has committed to publishing those decisions in full. In the period to 31 July 2024, no applications were received.
