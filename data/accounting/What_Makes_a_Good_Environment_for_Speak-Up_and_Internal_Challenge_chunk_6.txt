reassurance and encourage more to come forward. This can create a culture where team members trust those more senior to them to deal with concerns properly and where people do not feel the need to opt for external reporting or public disclosure. It is also important to perform regular reviews of concluded investigation work to identify and action any process improvements needed. Resolution and feedback Speaking up can be difficult and takes courage, so people must feel that it is worth the effort. Failure to take appropriate action on concerns raised undermines trust and potentially leads to increased misconduct rates and an overall decrease in employee morale. A robust and continuous feedback loop is central to an effective investigation process and builds trust, encouraging others to raise concerns, and providing insights for further process improvement. Review and reporting Regular reviews of speak-up arrangements seek to identify learning, recognise innovation, and support improvement, and ultimately, improve the experience of all team members. Review and analysis of the concerns reported and the outcomes from the investigation process, inform those in governance positions, and allow leadership to consider themes of poor behaviour and to design initiatives that will bring about the desired change. However, for reporting to be of most value, it is important to draw a link between the information reported and the health of the wider ethical culture, frequently and in sufficient depth. Support and Protection The ‘fear of reprisal’ is a significant barrier preventing team members from raising concerns. Speaking up and challenge is encouraged where people who exhibit such behaviours are protected against adverse repercussion, intimidation, disadvantage, or victimisation. A good understanding amongst all people of what constitutes acts of victimisation / retaliation is key to raise awareness and can be achieved through regular training and team discussion. It
