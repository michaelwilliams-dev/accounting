the levels of aggregation (or disaggregation) permitted and the order in which notes might be presented. No changes to disclosure requirements were made. However, one area where additional guidance was included related to the systematic manner in which the notes to the financial statements are presented. Company law requires the notes to the financial statements to be presented in a certain order. The amendments to paragraphs 113 and 114 of IAS 1 do not require entities to present notes to the financial statements in an order that would conflict with this legal requirement; however, some of the examples of how to present notes in a systematic manner are unlikely to comply with company law. An additional paragraph (paragraph A2.11A) in Appendix II Note on legal requirements was inserted. Classification of liabilities as current or non-current 65A In January 2020, the IASB amended IAS 1 to clarify the criteria for the classification of liabilities as either current or non-current. These criteria are referenced in paragraph A2.9B(c) of Appendix II Note on legal requirements. Consequently, paragraph A2.9B(c) of Appendix II was amended in the 2020/21 cycle to ensure consistency with IAS 1. A further amendment was made in the 2023/24 cycle following stakeholder feedback, to ensure consistency with paragraph 69(d) of IAS 1.

The new paragraphs require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes. These amendments were considered in the 2015/16 cycle. It was concluded that an exemption from this new requirement should be available. FRS 101 already included an exemption from the requirements of IAS 7, and
