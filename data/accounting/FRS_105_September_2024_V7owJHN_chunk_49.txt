the time of sale and the proceeds received from the bank. The micro-entity recognises a liability to the extent that it has collected funds from the debtors but has not yet remitted them to the bank.| Example 2: Debt factoring arrangement that does not qualify for derecognition| The facts are the same as in the preceding example except that the micro-entity has agreed to buy back from the bank any receivables for which the debtor is in arrears as to principal or interest for more than 120 days. In this case, the micro-entity has retained the risk of slow payment or non-payment by the debtors – a significant risk with respect to receivables. Accordingly, the micro-entity does not treat the receivables as having been sold to the bank, and it does not derecognise them. Instead, it treats the proceeds from the bank as a loan. The micro-entity continues to recognise the receivables as an asset until they are collected or written off as uncollectible.| Transfers of non-cash collateral When a micro-entity participates in arrangements where it provides or receives financial assets other than cash as collateral (eg a micro-entity pledges commercial papers as security against a loan), the micro-entity shall apply the requirements of paragraphs 11.35(b) to 11.35(d) of FRS 102. Derecognition of a financial liability A micro-entity shall derecognise a financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) only when it is extinguished – ie when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, is cancelled or expires.
