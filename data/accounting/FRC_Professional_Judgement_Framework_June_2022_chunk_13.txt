Biases can impinge on the auditor’s efforts to be objective at this step, as they can cause certain information sources to be favoured when they should not be. Awareness of relevant biases and consultation within the engagement team are valuable tools for the auditor in resisting these biases. Carry out the analysis This is the culmination of the prior two steps, where the auditor brings the information they have marshalled to bear in evaluating the various alternatives against the objectives articulated for that judgement. Evaluating the various pieces of information gathered in the context of the judgement being made, and in light of each other, will likely lead to a better judgement being made, than if each piece of evidence was simply considered in isolation. The auditor is required by auditing standards to carefully consider the relevance and reliability of the information gathered as audit evidence.9 It may be the case that the judgement being made involves assessing one or more pieces of information provided by the management of the audited entity; if such information is not of good quality, the auditor may find the best approach is to ask management to take the issue away and do further work on it, rather than risking inadvertently performing a management function. The auditor’s analysis will in large part depend on their assessment of the sufficiency, relevance and reliability of the information gathered. Biases are especially threatening at this step, as they can affect the weight placed on different pieces of information. That is, they can cause the auditor to falsely judge information of certain types (e.g. information generated via automated tools and techniques or information that corroborates an existing belief) to be more
