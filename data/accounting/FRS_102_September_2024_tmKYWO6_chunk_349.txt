performance obligations in the future; and the costs are expected to be recovered. An asset recognised in accordance with paragraph 23.117 gives rise to resources that the entity will use to satisfy future performance obligations in the contract. Conversely, costs that relate to performance obligations that are satisfied (or partially satisfied) shall be recognised as expenses when incurred, as those costs relate to past performance. Measurement after recognition After initial recognition, an entity shall measure assets recognised in accordance with paragraph 23.113 or 23.117 at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. An asset recognised in accordance with paragraph 23.113 or 23.117 shall be amortised in accordance with the pattern of transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. If an asset has been recognised in accordance with paragraph 23.113 or 23.117, an entity shall follow Section 27 Impairment of Assets for recognising and measuring the impairment of the asset. However, an entity shall apply paragraph 23.122 instead of paragraphs 27.11 to 27.20A to estimate the recoverable amount of such an asset. The recoverable amount of an asset recognised in accordance with paragraph 23.113 or 23.117 is: the remaining amount of consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services to which the asset relates; less the costs that relate directly to providing those goods or services and that have not been recognised as expenses. In applying paragraph 23.122(a), an entity shall determine the amount of consideration that the entity expects to receive by using the principles for determining the transaction price (except for the requirements in paragraph 23.46 on constraining estimates of variable consideration) and adjusting that amount to reflect the effects of the customerâ€™s credit risk.
