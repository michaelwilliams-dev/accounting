to do this as additional disclosures cannot be mandated of small entities under the EU Accounting Directive. B26.11 Consequently, no wholesale changes were made to Section 26 but minor improvements were made to align some of the definitions used in the section with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. However, it was noted that the issue should be revisited in the future if company law changes such that disclosures could be mandated for small companies.

Paragraph 1AC.31D has been inserted, which requires a small entity to provide some, but not all, of the disclosures set out in Section 26.
