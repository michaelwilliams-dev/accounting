An example is when the entity is a co-operative, owned by its employees, and all of the shares are held in a trust for the benefit of the employees but the shares never vest in individual employees with dividends from the company being distributed to employees solely in accordance with the provisions of the trust deed.

Where a payment to an intermediary is an exchange by the micro-entity of one asset for another, any assets that the intermediary acquires in a subsequent exchange transaction will also be under the control of the micro-entity. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of the intermediary shall be accounted for by the micro-entity as an extension of its own business and recognised in its financial statements. An asset will cease to be recognised as an asset of the micro-entity when, for example, the asset of the intermediary vests unconditionally with identified beneficiaries. A micro-entity may distribute its own equity instruments, or other equity instruments, to an intermediary in order to facilitate employee shareholdings under a remuneration scheme. Where this is the case and the micro-entity has control, or de facto control, of the assets and liabilities of the intermediary, the commercial effect is that the micro-entity is,
