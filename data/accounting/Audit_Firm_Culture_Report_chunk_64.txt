seen to be best achieved by the audit team lead finding a ‘middle ground’ when engaging with the engagement lead by not being too informal (i.e. being overly friendly or familiar), nor too far removed or unfriendly (i.e. by appearing distant or intimidating). Where this ‘middle ground’ is struck, auditors felt they are more able to challenge audited entities as they feel assured that there is a mutual level of respect between the two organisations, and that the audited entity is less likely to see challenge as confrontational. “We have regular progress calls […] when you have less communication, it comes as more of a shock and then you get pushback.” (Assistant manager / Manager) “You need a good working relationship [with the audited entity]. It’s important that there is a mutual respect and understanding of the role auditors play. We are working for the public interest and reporting to shareholders. In my experience, you can have a more open discussion where there is mutual respect.” (Partner) Auditors raised a number of examples as to how this might be achieved including effective meetings at the start of an engagement, and communicating with the audited entity frequently once the engagement is underway. By outlining the timeline and key deadlines at the start of the engagement, then regularly checking in with the engagement lead (e.g. by scheduling weekly calls and sending regular email updates), not only does this create space for a strong rapport to develop and help the auditor appear less distant or intimidating, but it also means the audit team are able to raise any potential issues as early as possible. This helps avoid last minute delays which may otherwise feel like a ‘surprise’ to the audited entity and be met with greater resistance, making it more difficult to apply
