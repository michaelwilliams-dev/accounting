the subcontractor as soon as itâ€™s practical for the contractor to do so. Making a payment under deduction Deductions must only be made from that part of the payment that does not represent the cost of materials incurred by the subcontractor. Any travelling expenses (including fuel costs) and subsistence paid to or on behalf of the subcontractor must be included in the gross amount of payment and the amount from which the deduction is made. How to calculate the amount to deduct There are 2 steps that contractors must follow. Work out the gross amount from which a deduction will be made by excluding VAT charged by the subcontractor if the subcontractor is registered for VAT, read the examples in Appendix D. The contractor will need to keep a record of the gross payment amounts so that they can enter these on their monthly returns. Deduct from the gross payment the amount the subcontractor actually paid for the following items used in the construction operations, including VAT paid if the subcontractor is not registered for VAT: materials (read paragraph 3.13) consumable stores fuel (except fuel for travelling) plant hire (read paragraph 3.14) the cost of manufacture or prefabrication of materials Materials The contractor can ask the subcontractor for evidence of the direct cost of materials. The contractor must always check and keep records to make sure that the part of the payment for materials supplied is not overstated. If the materials element looks to be excessive we may seek to recover any under deduction from the contractor. On making a contract payment to a subcontractor, it is only where a subcontractor directly pays for the materials purchased to fulfil a particular construction contract, that the cost in question may be deducted from the total sum of the contract payment before
