factors are relevant to such consideration. In explaining the extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, the auditor should consider how their approach to the audit has affected the likelihood of detection. This will be affected by the inherent difficulty in detecting them, the effectiveness of the entity’s controls, and the nature, timing and extent of the audit procedures performed. Irregularities that result from fraud might be inherently more difficult to detect than irregularities that result from error. The auditor’s responsibilities for the engagement will mean 1 Significance is defined in the FRC’s Glossary of Terms. that detection of those types of irregularity which give rise to a risk of material misstatement are those on which the auditor is able to provide the most comprehensive explanation. For example: Where the auditor has identified legislation of particular relevance to the entity, what procedures did the auditor design to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding compliance with that legislation? Did the audit team identify particular areas that were susceptible to misstatement as part of their fraud discussion? The auditor may find it helpful, in developing their explanation, to review the following documentation: The auditor’s assessment of the susceptibility of the entity’s financial statements to material misstatement,2 including how fraud might occur.3 The engagement partner’s assessment of whether the engagement team collectively had the appropriate competence and capabilities to identify or recognise non-compliance with laws and regulations, and details of those matters about non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud that were communicated to the engagement team.4 The auditor’s understanding of the entity’s current activities, the scope of its authorisation and the effectiveness of its control environment where the entity is a regulated entity.5 Communications with component auditors to request identification of any instances of non- compliance
