other than that the entities are controlled by the same owner, the accounting for the loan will be the same as shown in Example 3 above for a fixed term interest-free loan between fellow subsidiaries. As noted in Example 2 above, a fixed term interest-free loan consists, in substance, of two separate components. In the case of a fixed term interest-free loan between entities that are owned by the same person, the first component represents a loan made at a market-rate of interest and the second component is a distribution or capital contribution. The accounting is demonstrated in the numerical example below. An entity makes a fixed term interest-free loan of CU1,000 to another entity. Both entities have the same owner. The present value of the loan using a market rate of interest for a similar loan is CU9007. The lending entity records the following accounting entries: Dr Loan receivable from related party CU900 Dr Distribution (equity)8 CU100 Cr Cash CU1,000 The borrowing entity records the following accounting entries: Dr Cash CU1,000 Cr Loan repayable to related party CU900 Cr Capital contribution (equity) CU100 7 See Example 6 below for the calculation of the present value and a demonstration of the subsequent accounting for an interest-free loan. 8 In accordance with paragraph 22.17 of FRS 102 a distribution is recorded as a reduction of equity. A distribution recorded in Example 5: Fixed term interest-free loans between entities and their directors A fixed term interest-free loan may be made between an entity and its director(s). The accounting for the measurement difference arising on the initial recognition of the loan will depend on whether the loan was made in the directorâ€™s capacity as a shareholder or for another reason. For example, in a situation where a director is the majority shareholder it
