Registered Office: 8th Floor, 125 London Wall, London EC2Y 5AS Introduction This publication addresses the traditional use of Offshore Delivery Centres (ODCs), known as the Shared Service Model. Under this approach, ODCs are used for routine, non-judgemental, and less complex aspects of audit work, and certain administrative procedures, which are assigned by the onshore audit teams. These are usually pre-defined in a “catalogue” of services. The drivers for this model are improving audit quality, cost savings and efficiency arising from standardisation of work. In recent years, some UK audit firms have expanded the scope of work being performed by ODCs to include more complex and/or judgemental tasks and are allowing offshore staff to engage directly with the audited entity’s management. Some firms are also adopting an ’Extended Team Model’. Neither of these are discussed here. The purpose of this publication is to share good practice points that we have observed in relation to the ODC Shared Service Model. It is important that firms wishing to consider these points do not see them as a mandatory checklist. Firms should take a customised and proportionate approach to setting up, operating and monitoring ODCs in accordance with their strategic and quality objectives, taking into account the key risks to these objectives and their risk appetite.
