when there is clear evidence of an increase in selling price less costs to complete and sell because of changed economic circumstances, the entity shall reverse the amount of the impairment (ie the reversal is limited to the amount of the original impairment loss) so that the new carrying amount is the lower of the cost and the revised selling price less costs to complete and sell. Impairment of assets other than inventories General principles If, and only if, the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the entity shall reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its recoverable amount. That reduction is an impairment loss. Paragraphs 27.11 to 27.20A provide guidance on measuring recoverable amount. An entity shall recognise an impairment loss immediately in profit or loss, unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount in accordance with another section of this FRS (for example, in accordance with the revaluation model in Section 17 Property, Plant and Equipment). Any impairment loss of a revalued asset shall be treated as a revaluation decrease in accordance with that other section. Indicators of impairment An entity shall assess at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. If there is no indication of impairment, it is not necessary to estimate the recoverable amount. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, an entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. This may be the case because measuring recoverable amount requires forecasting cash flows, and sometimes individual assets do not generate cash flows by themselves. An assetâ€™s cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable
