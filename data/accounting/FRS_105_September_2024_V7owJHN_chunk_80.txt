in the examples. References to ‘best estimate’ are to the present value amount, when the effect of the time value of money is material. Example 1 Future operating losses 16A.1 A micro-entity determines that it is probable that it will incur future operating losses for several years. Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event: There is no past event that obliges the micro-entity to pay out resources. Conclusion: The micro-entity does not recognise a provision for future operating losses. Expected future losses do not meet the definition of a liability. The expectation of future operating losses may be an indicator that one or more assets are impaired (see Section 22 Impairment of Assets of this FRS). Example 2 Onerous contracts 16A.2 An onerous contract is one in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. For example, a micro-entity may be contractually required under an operating lease to make payments to lease an asset for which it no longer has any use. The cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract and an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts. Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event: The micro-entity is contractually required to pay out resources for which it will not receive commensurate benefits. Conclusion: If a micro-entity has a contract that is onerous, the micro-entity recognises and measures the present obligation under the contract as a provision.
