made as being whether the company’s presentation of the capital management disclosure showing net debt constitutes a material misstatement and, if so, how the disclosure could be modified so that it is no longer materially misstated. The engagement partner articulates their objectives for this judgement as follows: To be able to express the appropriate opinion as to whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards and are true and fair FRC | Professional Judgement Guidance 25 That the intended users’ understanding of the financial position and performance of F plc is enhanced Next, the engagement partner considers the alternatives available to choose between. The engagement partner sees her four options as being: The disclosure is not materially misstated The disclosure is materially misstated and the information relating to net debt should be deleted The disclosure is materially misstated and the information relating to net debt should be modified The disclosure is materially misstated and the information relating to net debt should be supported by further clarifying information The engagement partner knows that IFRS is a fair presentation framework, and that it requires that the financial statements must fairly present the financial position and performance of the entity. IFRS defines the objective of the financial statements as being to provide information about the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions. Her concern, then, is that the capital management disclosure referencing net debt obscures useful information, or is actively misleading, regarding the level of net debt that the company carried for most of the year. If it does so, it is arguably not fairly presented and thus not in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards.
