that it omits figures for their speak up and whistleblowing cases in dashboards as those could be interpreted twofold – an increase could be a sign of people feeling more able to come forward and openly speak up, but it also could be a matter of concern that poor practices are increasing. To demonstrate how culture can be measured and monitored, including the use of dashboards, please see the case study on page 38. Joining the dots While ethics & compliance and HR functions most commonly lead on culture reviews, other teams also have a role to play. Making sure that all information gathered is joined together will provide a richer set of data to help organisations better understand their culture and a more cohesive approach between different initiatives across the organisation.

This includes how risk issues such as compliance, internal controls and risk appetite link to rewards and setting the tone from the top, i.e. values and behaviours.
