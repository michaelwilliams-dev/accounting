subject to the following provisions. The articles of a private limited company may exclude or restrict the issue of redeemable shares. A public limited company may only issue redeemable shares if it is authorised to do so by its articles. No redeemable shares may be issued at a time when there are no issued shares of the company that are not redeemable. Terms and manner of redemption The directors of a limited company may determine the terms, conditions and manner of redemption of shares if they are authorised to do so— by the company's articles, or by a resolution of the company. A resolution under subsection (1)(b) may be an ordinary resolution, even though it amends the company's articles. Where the directors are authorised under subsection (1) to determine the terms, conditions and manner of redemption of shares— they must do so before the shares are allotted, and any obligation of the company to state in a statement of capital the rights attached to the shares extends to the terms, conditions and manner of redemption. Where the directors are not so authorised, the terms, conditions and manner of redemption of any redeemable shares must be stated in the company's articles. Payment for redeemable shares Redeemable shares in a limited company may not be redeemed unless they are fully paid. The terms of redemption of shares in a limited company may provide that the amount payable on redemption may, by agreement between the company and the holder of the shares, be paid on a date later than the redemption date.
