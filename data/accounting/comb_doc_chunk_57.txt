17 Property, Plant and Equipment. On transition A transitional provision has been introduced in paragraph 1.19(a). An entity that chooses to measure investment properties rented to another group entity under the cost model going forward has a choice of accounting treatment on transition: apply the transitional provision which allows an entity to take the fair value at the date of transition (ie not the current carrying amount) and use that as the property’s deemed cost going forward; or use the historical cost of the property, and depreciate/impair the asset as if it had always been carried at cost. An entity has a free choice but the availability of information and the work required to determine the carrying value at the transition date, prior year end and current year end may lead an entity to take the transitional exemption for ease. When an entity chooses to take the fair value at the date of transition as deemed cost going forward, the investment property is not carried on a cost basis and is instead measured under the alternative accounting rules. Therefore any fair value uplift existing on transition must be recognised in a revaluation reserve and additional disclosures required by paragraph 34 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations must be given. Introduction of a principle for the classification of financial instruments Amendments to Section 11 Basic Financial Instruments Previously, the classification of financial instruments as ‘basic’ or ‘other’ was dependent on a list of prescriptive conditions set out in paragraph 11.9. Paragraph 11.9A has been inserted to add a principles-based description of a ‘basic’ financial instrument. This paragraph need only be considered for debt instruments that do not meet the detailed conditions. We expect that this amendment will result in a relatively small number of financial instruments, which breach the detailed conditions,
