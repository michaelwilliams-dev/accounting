Directors’ Report) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/409)’, ‘The Companies, Partnerships and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2015 (SI 2015/980)’, ‘The Companies and Limited Liability Partnership (Accounts and Audit Exemptions and Change of Accounting Framework) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/2301)’ and ‘The Small Companies (Micro-entities’ Accounts) Regulations 2013 (SI 2013/3008). In an Irish context reference should be made to the relevant sections and paragraphs of Irish company law and the IAS Regulation. Such general references are not dealt with in the table below. References in the text to ‘IAS accounts’ are to be read as ‘IFRS financial statements’ in Irish company law. IFRS financial statements are within the scope of the IAS Regulation. For the purposes of the table below, where general references are made in the text of this FRS to Schedules to the Regulations, the approach taken is that the corresponding Schedule to the Companies Act 2014 is referenced. For example, a reference to Schedule 1 to the Regulations would correspond to a reference to Schedule 3 to the Companies Act 2014 (Accounting principles, form and content of entity financial statements). The corresponding Irish reference used for Schedule 3 to the Regulations is the European Union (Insurance Undertakings: Financial Statements) Regulations 2015 (SI No. 262 of 2015) (Insurance Undertakings Regulations 2015). Where reference is made in this Appendix to Schedule 3 to the Companies Act 2014, Irish entities applying the Credit Institutions Regulations 2015 (the European Union (Credit Institutions: Financial Statements) Regulations 2015 (SI No. 266 of 2015)) or the Insurance Undertakings Regulations 2015 should read the references as referring to the corresponding paragraphs in those regulations where applicable. The requirements of Schedule 3 to the Companies Act 2014 are not necessarily the same as those contained in the Credit Institutions Regulations 2015 or in the Insurance Undertakings Regulations 2015 in
