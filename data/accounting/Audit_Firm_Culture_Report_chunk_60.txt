most under pressure. “Two hours or more for training in one sitting is ineffective because of brain capacity. It's difficult to complete e-learning remotely because you can zone out.” (Assistant manager / Manager) In particular, for a small number of new starters remote training delivered in this way felt particularly hard to engage with. This is caused by new auditors being faced with high volumes of onboarding training that is either pre-recorded, meaning they are not interactive, or delivered in lengthy presentation-style sessions. The volume of videos to get through as part of the onboarding process make training on scepticism and challenge feel like one of many, so these auditors see them as more of a ‘tick box’ exercise. As a result, auditors are often powering through training related to scepticism and challenge so are less able to interact, engage and practise exercising either behaviour than during more interactive sessions that use real-life scenarios or case studies, whether delivered virtually or in-person. However, when virtual training is delivered using techniques outlined earlier in this report, such as through making them interactive or using case studies, auditors do feel that they can be as effective as in-person learning. Implications: How training, coaching, and mentoring can drive desired auditor behaviours By factoring coaching responsibilities into the workload of senior auditors To be most effective, audit managers and above should have coaching factored into their job to ensure they can take the time to support and coach junior auditors. Likewise, those in more senior roles should try to involve junior colleagues wherever possible to encourage learning on the job, even if speaking to clients virtually (e.g. inviting associates to join client calls when working from home). By encouraging and facilitating more interaction between junior and senior auditors day-to-day Coaching works best when the
