the UK is already very generous. But the nature of additional work being described above is highly nuanced, and it will require attracting the very best governance talent worldwide, especially for the top UK companies. Currently, there is a substantial pay difference for audit-committee directors between the FTSE 100 and the S&P 500: roughly £100K for the former and $300K for the latter. Perhaps this pay difference reflects the differential expectations of audit-committee members in the UK versus the US – that US directors, operating under the Sarbanes-Oxley regime, must work much harder than their British counterparts? But if so, that is hardly an attractive situation for Corporate Britain. Conclusion: I will conclude with one further observation: on the public-interest purpose of auditing.

The media occasionally bandies about that purpose in its, often justified, criticisms of audit-firm practices. But, that public purpose is sometimes misstated and misunderstood, so it bears clarification. The public purpose of auditing stems from the systemic benefits of audits to the integrity and stability of our market-capitalist system, where (share) ownership and management are separated.

So, auditors have a dual mandate to both their clients (i.e., the shareholders of the entities they audit) and to the system as a whole (i.e., to safeguard public trust in capital markets). This is akin to the dual mandate that lawyers have to both their clients and to the interests of justice, as a whole, in society. In the vast majority of cases, these interests are aligned, in that the broader (systemic) interest is served through the
