transition to FRS 101 was introduced. Paragraph 11(b) of FRS 100 was also amended for consistency. IFRS 3 Business Combinations Contingent consideration In December 2013, the IASB issued its Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010â€“2012 Cycle that, inter alia, amended the requirements in relation to contingent consideration set out in paragraphs 40 and 58 of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
