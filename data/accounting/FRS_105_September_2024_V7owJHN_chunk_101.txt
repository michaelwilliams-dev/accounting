takes place; and the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Section 19 Government Grants Scope of this section This section applies to government grants. Government grants exclude those forms of government assistance that cannot reasonably have a value placed upon them and transactions with government that cannot be distinguished from the normal trading transactions of the micro-entity. Recognition and measurement Government grants, including non-monetary grants, shall not be recognised until there is reasonable assurance that: the micro-entity will comply with the conditions attaching to them; and the grants will be received. A micro-entity shall measure grants at the fair value of the asset received or receivable. Where a grant becomes repayable it shall be recognised as a liability when the repayment meets the definition of a liability. A micro-entity shall classify a grant, or each part of a grant, either as a grant relating to revenue or a grant relating to assets. Government grants relating to revenue shall be recognised in income on a systematic basis over the periods in which the micro-entity recognises the related costs for which the grant is intended to compensate. A government grant that becomes receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the micro-entity with no future related costs shall be recognised as income in profit or loss in the period in which it becomes receivable. Government grants relating to assets shall be recognised in income on a systematic basis over the expected useful life of the asset. Where part of a government grant relating to an asset is deferred it shall be recognised as deferred income and not deducted from the carrying amount of the asset.
