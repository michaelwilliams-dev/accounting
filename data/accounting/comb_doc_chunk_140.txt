or a rate that discounts the nominal value of the instrument to the current cash sales prices of the goods or services. (FRS 102 paragraph 23.5)| Both standards permit discounting, therefore there does not appear to be any significant difference in the treatment of deferred payment arrangements, although FRS 102 is more prescriptive regarding the discount rate. Risk of default FRS 5 â€“ Application Note G|FRS 102| Requires that where, at the time revenue is recognised, there is a significant risk that there will be default, then an adjustment is made to the amount of revenue recognised. (FRS 5 paragraph G9)|Requires that revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Although it does not explicitly address the risk of default at the time of recognition, a fair value measurement would be expected to reflect any significant credit risk. Further, the revenue recognition criteria for the sale of goods or the rendering of services, requires that revenue is recognised only when it is probable (more likely than not) that the economic benefits will flow to the entity. (FRS 102 paragraph 23.10(d) and 23.14(b))| Where there is a risk of default at the time of revenue recognition, FRS 5 takes this into account when measuring revenue, which at the extreme could result in no revenue being recognised at that time. FRS 102 requires that, if the risk of default is so high that it is not probable that any payment would be received, no revenue should be recognised until receipt is probable. Therefore in practice the amount recognised may not differ. Detailed recognition requirements Point of recognition for sale of goods FRS 5|FRS 102| Treats the sale of goods as derecognition of the stock and recognition of a new asset, usually a debtor.
