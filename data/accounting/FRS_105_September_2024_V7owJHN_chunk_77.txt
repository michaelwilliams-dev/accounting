outcomes, and each point in that range is as likely as any other, the mid-point of the range is used. When the provision arises from a single obligation, the individual most likely outcome may be the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation. However, even in such a case, the micro-entity considers other possible outcomes. When other possible outcomes are either mostly higher or mostly lower than the most likely outcome, the best estimate will be a higher or lower amount. When the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of a provision shall be the present value of the amount expected to be required to settle the obligation. The discount rate (or rates) shall be a pre-tax rate (or rates) that reflect(s) current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the liability. The risks specific to the liability shall be reflected either in the discount rate or in the estimation of the amounts required to settle the obligation, but not both. A micro-entity shall exclude gains from the expected disposal of assets from the measurement of a provision. When some or all of the amount required to settle a provision may be reimbursed by another party (eg through an insurance claim), the micro-entity shall recognise the reimbursement as a separate asset only when it is virtually certain that the micro-entity will receive the reimbursement on settlement of the obligation. The amount recognised for the reimbursement shall not exceed the amount of the provision. The reimbursement receivable shall be presented in the statement of financial position as an asset and shall not be offset against the provision. In the income statement the expense relating to a provision may be presented net of the amount recognised for a reimbursement.
