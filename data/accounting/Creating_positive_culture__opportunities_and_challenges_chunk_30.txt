By comparing findings from the questionnaire with the level of disclosure on culture in our sample of stewardship reports, several observations emerged: The majority of respondents agreed that investors’ increased attention to their own culture can have an impact on their portfolio companies. This compares with just over a half of investors who discussed their firm’s culture in their reporting. Over a half of respondents confirmed that they are looking at corporate culture as a key factor to consider when investing. However, only a half of respondents and half of analysed stewardship reports consider culture not only from the perspective of business risk, but also an opportunity coming from a positive working culture or strategic advantage. A great majority of respondents believe that collaborative engagement is an effective way to influence a portfolio company’s corporate culture but only a small number of analysed reports covered external engagement on culture as a specific issue. All respondents to the questionnaire agreed that companies should use a wide range of metrics to assess impact. This sharply contrasts with investors’ own reporting, as only a very small number of firms made any mention of measurement in relation to their own culture. When measurement was discussed in their reports, it was confined to internal staff surveys.
