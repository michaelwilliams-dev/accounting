In addition, FRS 102 will continue to be subject to periodic reviews to consider stakeholder feedback, minor changes in IFRS Accounting Standards and the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard and other issues.

However, the FRC will continue to assess emerging issues as they arise to determine whether action needs to be taken. When necessary this will include issuing amendments to standards outside regular review cycles.
