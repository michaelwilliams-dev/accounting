General proceduresÕ of this guide explains how to work out PAY E and National Insurance contributions for various pay intervals. For National Insurance contributions purposes, the deemed employment payment should be aggregated with any other earnings (paid to the worker by the intermediary in the year) which are derived from employed earnerÕs employment. The amount of Class 1 National Insurance contributions payable in respect of that aggregate amount should be calculated using an annual earnings period, irrespective of whether the worker is a director of the company in the tax year. Where the provisions of the Intermediaries Regulations apply to the worker from the beginning of the tax year, the worker will have an annual earnings period. Where a later start date applies the worker is prescribed a pro rata annual earnings period. Read CA44: National Insurance for company directors .
