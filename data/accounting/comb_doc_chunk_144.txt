two standards are similar. Contingent fee arrangements will normally be accounted for under paragraphs 23.14 to 23.16 of FRS 102. Unbundling of contracts FRS 5 Guidance Note G|FRS 102| A contractual arrangement should be accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other. ‘Operate independently’ means that each component represents a separable good or service that the seller can provide to customers, either on a stand-alone basis or as an optional extra.

For example, when the selling price of a product includes an identifiable amount for subsequent servicing. Conversely, an entity applies the recognition criteria to two or more transactions together when they are linked in such a way that the commercial effect cannot be understood without reference to the series of transactions as a whole.

They also both require that more than one contract is considered together where this is necessary to understand and
