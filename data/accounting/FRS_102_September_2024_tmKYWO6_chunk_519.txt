in the income statement reflects the cost to the entity and net presentation therefore does not conflict with the Regulations. A3.23 FRS 102 requires that a financial asset and financial liability are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position, if certain criteria are met (see paragraph 11.38A of FRS 102). The net presentation does not conflict with paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations, because provided the criteria for the net presentation are met, the presentation reflects the expected net cash flows from settling two or more separate financial instruments.

Where the cost model is applied, sections 611 to 615 of the Act set out the treatment where 'merger relief' or 'group reconstruction relief' are available. These reliefs reduce the amount required to be included in share premium; they also (in section 615) allow the initial carrying amount to be adjusted downwards so it is equal to either the previous carrying amount of the investment in the transferor's books or the nominal value of the shares issued, depending on which relief applies. If the fair value model in paragraph 9.26 is used, then the relief in section 615 is not available, so the investment's carrying value may not be reduced, although the provisions in sections 611 and 612 remain relevant in respect of amounts required to be recorded in share premium. A3.24A Section 615 permits the relief to be reflected in determining the amount at which the shares or other consideration provided for the shares issued are recognised. Therefore, when applying the cost model, any other consideration transferred may also be
