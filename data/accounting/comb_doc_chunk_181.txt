amount of CU100,000 were used as its deemed cost, in order to comply with company law the revaluation reserve would be retained and the excess depreciation would continue to be offset against it. If the property is restated to the original cost of CU1,000 the following adjustment would be required: Dr|Revaluation Reserve|CU84,660| Dr|Accumulated depreciation|CU14,3405| Cr|Property, plant and equipment|CU99,000| Property B No adjustment is required on transition for Property B6. Example 4 Carrying value of development costs Entity D had previously made an accounting policy choice to capitalise development costs meeting the criteria set out in SSAP 13 Accounting for research and development.7In 2010 Entity D undertook a programme to develop the products it acquired as part of an earlier acquisition to make them compatible with products it had developed in-house. In accordance with SSAP 13, it capitalised CU2,500 of expenditure which it is amortising over five years. Four years later at 31 December 2013, the carrying amount of asset was therefore CU500. Paragraph 18.8H of FRS 102 permits an entity to recognise an intangible asset arising from the development phase of an internal project providing it meets certain criteria. Entity D makes the accounting policy choice to capitalise development costs meeting the criteria set out in Section 18 Intangible Assets other than Goodwill of FRS 102. As permitted by paragraph 35.10(n), Entity D may elect to take the carrying amount of those development costs deferred in accordance with SSAP 13 at the date of transition to be the deemed cost going forward. Therefore, although in this example it is unlikely that there is a material difference between the carrying value of the development costs measured using SSAP 13 or FRS 102, for ease Entity D elects to retain the value determined in accordance with SSAP 13 as the deemed cost
