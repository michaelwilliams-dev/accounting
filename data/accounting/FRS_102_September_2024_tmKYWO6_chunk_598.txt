As a result, some of the disclosure requirements of FRS 102 would be inconsistent with the application of the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS 9. This particularly applied to the disclosure requirements for financial institutions.

The FRC also noted that the proposed first triennial review of FRS 102 was too far in the future and consequential amendments to FRS 102 may therefore be untimely for entities that would like to apply the new IFRS 9 accounting requirements without undue delay. For that reason the FRC noted that a proposed amendment to FRS 102 would be issued for public consultation once the IASB has completed the hedge accounting projects.
