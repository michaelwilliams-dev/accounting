external assurance. We also want to identify any differences between NHS provider and ICB audits and local government audits to inform a proportionate approach to regulatory frameworks. The findings from the study will inform the FRCâ€™s policy and work relating to local audit, and may result in potential suggestions for action which the FRC will seek further comment on from stakeholders before recommending to Government. This market study will also consider whether there are any lessons on good practice seen in the NHS audit market which would be carried over into the wider local audit market, such as with local government bodies. Taking part The FRC is engaging with the Department for Health and Social Care and NHS England, as well as the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, as it undertakes this market study. This market study is being carried out the basis of voluntary contributions. Stakeholders taking part in the market study will have the opportunity to develop our understanding of the market and inform our approach to future local audit work. The FRC is keen to hear from those organisations and individuals involved in the market for the audit of NHS Providers and ICBs, as well as any other relevant parties who wish to comment.
