financial statements are set out in the applicable sections of this FRS. The failure to recognise an item that satisfies the recognition criteria, and that would otherwise provide relevant information, is not rectified by disclosure of the accounting policies used or by notes or explanatory material. Unless explicitly required or permitted by this FRS, an entity shall not recognise items in the statement of financial position that do not meet the definition of assets or of liabilities regardless of whether they result from applying the notion commonly referred to as ‘matching’ for measuring profit or loss. An item that fails to meet the recognition criteria may qualify for recognition at a later date as a result of subsequent circumstances or events. Relevance Information about assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses is relevant to users of financial statements. However, recognition of a particular asset or liability and any resulting income, expenses or changes in equity may not always provide relevant information. That may be the case if, for example, it is uncertain whether an asset or liability exists; or an asset or liability exists, but the probability of an inflow or outflow of economic benefits is low. The presence of one or both of the factors does not lead automatically to a conclusion that the information provided by recognition lacks relevance, as other factors may need to be taken into account. Existence uncertainty Uncertainty about whether an asset or liability exists, possibly combined with a low probability of inflows or outflows of economic benefits and an exceptionally wide range of possible outcomes, may mean that the recognition of an asset or liability, necessarily measured at a single amount, would not provide relevant information. Whether or not the asset or liability has been recognised, explanatory information about the associated uncertainties may need
