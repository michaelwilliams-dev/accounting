as a result of revisions to Section 20 Leases and Section 23 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and of other incremental improvements and clarifications. B35.3 As part of the Periodic Review 2024 amendments, the ability of a first-time adopter to select the ‘IAS 39 option’ in paragraphs 11.2(b) and 12.2(b) was restricted to situations in which selecting this option was necessary to achieve consistency with group financial statements (eg in the case of an entity which had not previously applied FRS 102 being acquired by a group that already applies the IAS 39 option). This is in preparation for the expected eventual removal of the IAS 39 option, as described in paragraph B11.5.
