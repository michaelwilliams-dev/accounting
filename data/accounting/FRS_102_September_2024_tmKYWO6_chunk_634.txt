liability being recognised in relation to a schedule of contributions that had been agreed with the defined benefit plan in order to address a deficit that had arisen on the basis of the funding assumptions. Further, the measurement of the present value of the obligations under the plan for funding purposes differs from the measurement for accounting purposes, but they are different measurements of the same obligation, not separate obligations. B28.13 Therefore, as a practical and proportionate solution, in measuring its defined benefit obligation an entity need not include the present value of contributions payable that arise from an agreement with the defined benefit plan to fund a deficit. Section 28 explicitly states that no additional liabilities shall be recognised in respect of an agreement with the defined benefit plan to fund a deficit (such as a schedule of contributions). This should ensure there are no divergent interpretations of the scope of Section 21 Provisions and Contingencies in relation to a schedule of contributions, because they are clearly within the scope of Section 28, and therefore outside the scope of Section 21. B28.14 Consideration was given to whether removing the restriction on recognising a defined benefit plan asset in some circumstances might be an alternative solution. However, this option was rejected because it could have the unintended consequence of permitting an asset to be recognised when other factors would indicate the reporting entity was not able to recover the surplus. B28.15 These amendments to FRS 102 do not affect the accounting for a schedule of contributions or other funding agreement between a reporting entity and a multi-employer plan, which is set out in paragraph 28.11A of FRS 102. When an entity participates in a defined benefit plan that is a multi-employer plan accounted for as if it were a defined
