in-force life assurance business (VIF) asset. IG2.55 Where a group reconstruction occurs and the new group carries on substantially the same insurance business as the group which it replaces (for example where a demutualisation is effected through the establishment of a proprietary company to acquire the business of an existing mutual insurer), any VIF which would be regarded as internally-generated under the former group structure should continue to be treated as such in the new group. Disaggregated information about single and regular premiums Paragraphs IG2.56 to IG2.58 are only relevant to long-term insurance business. IG2.56 New life insurance premiums are defined in the PRA rules as follows: ‘Single premium contracts shall consist of those contracts under which there is no expectation of continuing premiums being paid at regular intervals. Additional single premiums paid in respect of existing individual contracts shall be included. Regular premium contracts shall include those contracts under which premiums are payable at regular intervals during the policy year, including repeated or recurrent single premiums where the level of premiums is defined’. IG2.57 New annual and single premiums should be disclosed separately in the financial statements together with an explanation of the basis adopted for recognising premiums as either annual or single premiums. New annual premiums should be shown as the premiums payable in a full year (ie annual equivalent premium). Department for Work and Pensions rebates received on certain pensions contracts should be treated as single premiums. IG2.58 Internal transfers between products where open market options are available should be counted as new business. If no open market option exists, the transfer should not be treated as new business. Income statement (referred to as the profit and loss account in the Act) Paragraphs IG2.59 and IG2.60 provide guidance for applying the requirements of Part 1 General Rules
