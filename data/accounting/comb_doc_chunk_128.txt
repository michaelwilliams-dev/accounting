of the previous major inspection was identified in the transaction in which the item was acquired or constructed. If necessary, the estimated cost of a future similar inspection may be used as an indication of what the cost of the existing inspection component was when the item was acquired or constructed. (FRS 102 paragraph 17.7)| FRS 102 does not have an equivalent to paragraph 36(a) in FRS 15. However, in circumstances where subsequent expenditure has been incurred, the basic recognition criteria set out in paragraph 17.4 are still applicable. Therefore, in practice there is unlikely to be any change in accounting treatment as an assessment of the likelihood of future economic benefits occurring will still have to be made before an asset can be recognised.
