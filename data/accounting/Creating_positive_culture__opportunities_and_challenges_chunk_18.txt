That is not to say that site visits should never be used. Some have said that this form of direct engagement helped them to reach out to workers on the ground, experience the culture first- hand and build that ‘sense of connection’. However, boards should be cautious. Our review of workforce engagement published in 2021, stated that without a detailed information, it is impossible to know whether the visit offered structured and substantial discussions, leading to genuine insights from the workforce being fed back to the board, or was it simply an informal lunch at the site, where there was a general chat with a small number of staff. However, another company gave an example of how a reverse mentoring can in fact turn a site visit into a more meaningful and insightful experience. By proactively taking the time to walk the floor and connect with people on the front line, it helps to gain a different perspective. Across the organisation There is a general consensus that leaders need to be open and accessible with workers and other stakeholders, ensuring they feel listened to, trusted and empowered. Such engagement, through a debate, leads to more meaningful discussions, greater accountability and positive working culture. The pandemic posed a challenge for many leadership teams, with some devolving aspects of decision-making to local teams to enable them to respond quickly to local requirements, particularly around wellbeing and safety measures. By empowering local teams to make these decisions senior management are demonstrating trust in local management. Codes of ethics and conduct set out the standards of behaviour expected from workers. Such codes are useful, especially in the time of ambiguity, but they should not be used in isolation and are part of a package of engagement measures or tools to build transparency and trust.
