to The Friendly Societies (Accounts and Related Provisions) Regulations 1994 (SI 1994/1983); Schedule 1 to the Insurance Accounts Directive (Lloyd’s Syndicate and Aggregate Accounts) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/1950); Syndicate Accounting Byelaw (No 8 of 2005); and The Insurance Accounts Directive (Miscellaneous Insurance Undertakings) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/565). Appendix II Note on legal requirements Introduction A2.1 This appendix provides an overview of how the requirements in FRS 101 address United Kingdom company law requirements. It is therefore written from the perspective of a company to which the Companies Act 2006 applies. Limited liability partnerships (LLPs) are subject to similar legal requirements and therefore may find this appendix useful (see paragraph A2.21). Appendix III discusses Republic of Ireland legal references. A2.2 References to the Act in this appendix are to the Companies Act 2006. References to the Regulations are to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/410). References to specific provisions are to Schedule 1 to the Regulations; entities applying Schedules 2 or 3 should read them as referring to the equivalent paragraph in those schedules.

As stated in paragraph 4A of FRS 101, when a company prepares accounts in accordance with FRS 101, those accounts are Companies Act accounts and not IAS accounts as set out in section 395 of the Act. Therefore those accounts must comply with the applicable provisions of Parts 15 and 16 of the Act and with the Regulations.
