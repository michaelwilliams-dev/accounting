If the company is registered in Wales, you can choose to send your accounts in Welsh without an English translation. Companies can also send voluntary certified translations in an o?cial language of the EU. A voluntary translation must include a completed form VT01. 8. Micro-entity accounts There are 3 classifications of company size to consider when preparing your accounts - small, medium or large. For small companies there�s also sub-classification called a micro-entity, which applies to very small companies. To determine whether your company is a micro-entity, small or medium-sized, there are thresholds for: turnover balance sheet total (meaning the total of the fixed and current assets) the average number of employees Any companies that do not meet the criteria for micro-entities, small or medium are large companies. Large companies must prepare and submit full accounts. Micro-entities can prepare and file a balance sheet with less information than for a small, medium or large company. Additionally, a micro-entity can benefit from the exemptions available to small companies such as: exemption from audit the requirement to file a directors� report or profit and loss account at Companies House Micro-entities still need to send accounts to their members and file accounts at Companies House. If you think your company qualifies as a micro-entity, you may wish to consult a professional accountant before you prepare micro-entity accounts. 8.1
