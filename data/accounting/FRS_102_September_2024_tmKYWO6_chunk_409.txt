Accordingly, once the functional currency is determined, it can be changed only if there is a change to those underlying transactions, events and conditions. For example, a change in the currency that mainly influences the sales prices of goods and services may lead to a change in an entity’s functional currency. The effect of a change in functional currency is accounted for prospectively. In other words, an entity translates all items into the new functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of the change. The resulting translated amounts for non-monetary items are treated as their historical cost. Use of a presentation currency other than the functional currency Translation to the presentation currency An entity may present its financial statements in any currency (or currencies). If the presentation currency differs from the entity’s functional currency, the entity shall translate its items of income and expense and financial position into the presentation currency. For example, when a group contains individual entities with different functional currencies, the items of income and expense and financial position of each entity are expressed in a common currency so that consolidated financial statements may be presented. An entity whose functional currency is not the currency of a hyperinflationary economy shall translate its results and financial position into a different presentation currency using the following procedures: assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented (ie including comparatives) shall be translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement of financial position; income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income (ie including comparatives) shall be translated at exchange rates at the dates of the
