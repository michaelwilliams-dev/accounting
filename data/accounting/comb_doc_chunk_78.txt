the loan is made on these terms for a reason other than that the entities are controlled by the same owner, the accounting for the loan will be the same as shown in Example 3 above for a fixed term interest-free loan between fellow subsidiaries. As noted in Example 2 above, a fixed term interest-free loan consists, in substance, of two separate components. In the case of a fixed term interest-free loan between entities that are owned by the same person, the first component represents a loan made at a market-rate of interest and the second component is a distribution or capital contribution. The accounting is demonstrated in the numerical example below. An entity makes a fixed term interest-free loan of CU1,000 to another entity. Both entities have the same owner. The present value of the loan using a market rate of interest for a similar loan is CU9008. The lending entity records the following accounting entries: Dr||Loan receivable from related party|CU900| Dr| Cr|Distribution (equity)9 Cash|CU100 CU1,000| The borrowing entity records the following accounting entries: Dr Cash||CU1,000| Cr|Loan repayable to related party|CU900| Cr|Capital contribution (equity)|CU100| 8 See Example 6 below for the calculation of the present value and a demonstration of the subsequent accounting for an interest-free loan. 9 In accordance with paragraph 22.17 of FRS 102 a distribution is recorded as a reduction of equity. A distribution recorded in the financial statements in accordance with FRS 102 may not be a distribution as a matter of law. The legal requirements on distributable profits are not addressed in this factsheet. Technical Release 02/17BL considers issues concerning the determination of distributable profits and entities may refer to this or any successor document for more guidance.
