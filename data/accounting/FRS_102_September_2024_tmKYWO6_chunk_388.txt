benefit obligation and the related expense. If defined benefits are based on future salaries, the projected unit credit method requires an entity to measure its defined benefit obligations on a basis that reflects estimated future salary increases. Additionally, the projected unit credit method requires an entity to make various actuarial assumptions in measuring the defined benefit obligation, including discount rates, employee turnover, mortality, and (for defined benefit medical plans) medical cost trend rates. [Deleted] This FRS does not require an entity to engage an independent actuary to perform the comprehensive actuarial valuation needed to calculate its defined benefit obligation. Nor does it require that a comprehensive actuarial valuation must be done annually. In the periods between comprehensive actuarial valuations, if the principal actuarial assumptions have not changed significantly the defined benefit obligation can be measured by adjusting the prior period measurement for changes in employee demographics such as number of employees and salary levels. Plan introductions, changes, curtailments and settlements If a defined benefit plan has been introduced or the benefits have changed in the current period, the entity shall increase or decrease its net defined benefit liability to reflect the change, and shall recognise the increase (decrease) as an expense (income) in measuring profit or loss in the current reporting period. A If a defined benefit plan has been curtailed (ie benefits or group of covered employees are reduced) or settled (the relevant part of the employerâ€™s obligation is completely discharged) in the current period, the defined benefit obligation shall be decreased or eliminated, and the entity shall recognise the resulting gain or loss in profit or loss in the current reporting period. Defined benefit plan asset If the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date is less than the fair value of plan assets
