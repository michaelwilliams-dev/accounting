use of its share of the output of the joint venture, together with its share of any expenses incurred by the joint venture; and any expenses that it has incurred in respect of its interest in the joint venture. Disclosures A micro-entity shall disclose information in relation to financial commitments, guarantees and contingencies not recognised in the statement of financial position arising from its jointly controlled operations and jointly controlled assets in accordance with the relevant appendix in Section 6 Notes to the Financial Statements. Section 12 Property, Plant and Equipment and Investment Property Scope of this section This section applies to property, plant and equipment and investment property. Property, plant and equipment does not include biological assets related to agricultural activity (see Section 27 Specialised Activities). Recognition A micro-entity shall recognise the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment or investment property as an asset if, and only if: it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the micro-entity; and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and servicing equipment are recognised in accordance with this section when they meet the definition of property, plant and equipment. Otherwise, such items are classified as inventory. Parts of some items of property, plant and equipment or investment property may require replacement at regular intervals (eg the roof of a building). A micro-entity shall add to the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment or investment property the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost is incurred if the replacement part is expected to provide incremental future economic benefits to the micro-entity. The carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is derecognised in accordance with paragraphs 12.26
