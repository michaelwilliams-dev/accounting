The penalties when CIS returns are late If any of your CIS returns are one day late, we’ll charge an initial fixed penalty of £100. If we still have not received that return: 2 months after the date it was due, we’ll charge a second fixed penalty of £200 6 months after the date it was due, we’ll charge a further penalty of £300 or 5% of any liability to make payments that should have been shown in the return 12 months after the date it was due, we’ll charge a second further penalty — the amount of this penalty will depend on why your return was late The amount we’ll charge will be either £300 or 5% of any liability to make payments, or a ‘higher’ penalty of: up to 100% of any liability to make payments a minimum penalty of £1,500 or £3,000 We’ll charge a ‘higher’ penalty if we find out that you deliberately withheld information from us. There’s more information about this and about how we work out the second further penalty later in this factsheet. ‘Liability to make payments’ is the amount of any CIS deductions that a contractor should have deducted from payments to subcontractors and shown on their monthly CIS return. When a contractor first files a CIS return, if earlier CIS returns are also late, we may ‘cap’ the total amount of the £100 and £200 fixed penalties at a maximum of £3,000 for some returns. For more information about capping see page 2 of this factsheet.
