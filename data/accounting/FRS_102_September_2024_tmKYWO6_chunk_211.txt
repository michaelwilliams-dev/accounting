3-month IBOR did therefore not affect profit or loss during the period. The reclassification adjustment in accordance with paragraph 12.23(d)(ii) is nil. (Note that no accounting entry is shown below.) Note A: For illustrative purposes the accounting entry for interest payments is shown below. Note that in practice the accrual and payment of interest may be recorded in separate accounting entries. Accounting entries: Note that the accounting entries shown are only those relevant to demonstrate the effects of hedge accounting. In practice other accounting entries would be required, eg an entry to recognise the loan liability.

The cash flow hedge reserve moves from CU78,000 to (CU59,000), a change of (CU137,000). In accordance with paragraph 12.23(b), a loss of CU137,000 on the interest rate swap is recognised in other comprehensive income, as this part of the loss is fully off-set by the change in the cash flow hedge reserve. The remainder of the loss on the interest rate swap of CU30,000 is recognised in profit or loss, as required by paragraph 12.23(c). The fixed interest element on the hypothetical swap is CU430,000, whilst the variable rate component is CU500,000. The variability of the 3-month IBOR affects profit or loss during the period by CU70,000. Accordingly, the reclassification adjustment in accordance with paragraph 12.23(d)(ii) is CU70,000.
