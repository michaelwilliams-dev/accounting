then restated to comply with Section 7 Statement of Cash Flows of FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. In contrast to FRS 1, a cash flow statement prepared under FRS 102: reconciles the movement in cash and cash equivalents, not just cash; groups cash flows into fewer headings (ie cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities); reconciles profit to cash flows from operating activities starting from profit for the year rather than operating profit; and has fewer supporting notes. This Staff Education Note has been prepared to illustrate the format of the cash flow statement prepared in accordance with FRS 102 and assumes that there are no other changes arising from the application of FRS 102. In a full set of financial statements, comparatives would be provided. There are no requirements in the Regulations1 in respect of cash flow statements. This Staff Education Note is written to highlight key areas of consideration when transitioning to FRS 102 and is not designed to be exhaustive.
