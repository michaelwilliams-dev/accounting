there has been a heightened focus on audit quality in recent years, and research participants perceived this as a positive and significant cultural shift, particularly senior auditors. Most research participants across all levels of staff sampled have a relatively strong understanding of the need to demonstrate behaviours that are most directly correlated to high quality audit, specifically professional scepticism and effective challenge of management. However, when it comes to putting these behaviours into practice, senior auditors and audit managers (particularly senior managers) tend to have a deeper understanding of what these behaviours actually look like, and how they ladder up to a high-quality audit, compared to junior auditors who have had less experience in their careers to date. Common themes within the drivers of, and barriers to, desired auditor behaviours Throughout this study, we uncovered a significant number of drivers and barriers within the environment of the audit firm that either encourage or inhibit an auditor’s ability to show the desired behaviours during their day-to-day work on audit engagements. The full set of drivers and barriers against different cultural areas are outlined in detail in the tables within sections 3.2 and 3.3 pages 12-18. Across the cultural aspects explored in depth in this research, there were also a number of key recurring themes in respect of the factors that encourage professional scepticism and effective challenge. Importantly, the most powerful drivers are dependent upon the strength of human interactions – how staff and teams are influenced by, and are inspired to emulate, ‘leaders in motion’: Teaching and embedding desired auditor behaviour: Bringing the specific behaviours linked to high quality audit to life, through the use of case studies, and training calling out these behaviours explicitly and explaining what they mean in practice. Also critical to this is the training in soft
