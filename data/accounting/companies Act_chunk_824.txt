For the purposes of this section a resolution is supported by a solvency statement ifâ€” the directors of the company make a solvency statement (see section 643) not more than 15 days before the date on which the resolution is passed, and the resolution and solvency statement are registered in accordance with section 720B. Where the resolution is proposed as a written resolution, a copy of the solvency statement must be sent or submitted to every eligible member at or before the time at which the proposed resolution is sent or submitted to the member. Where the resolution is proposed at a general meeting, a copy of the solvency statement must be made available for inspection by members of the company throughout that meeting. The validity of a resolution is not affected by a failure to comply with subsection (3) or (4). Section 717 (resolution authorising payment: exercise of voting rights) applies to a resolution under this section as it applies to a resolution under section 716.
