revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. B23.3 Stakeholder feedback received by the FRC supported the principle of incorporating the revenue recognition model from IFRS 15 into FRS 102, providing this was done in a proportionate manner. B23.4 In 2022, the IASB proposed an approach for updating the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard to reflect the principles of IFRS 15. The IASB’s proposed requirements were simpler than IFRS 15, containing fewer disclosure requirements, more succinct drafting, and simpler language. The FRC considered those proposals to be an appropriate basis for proposing amendments to FRS 102 to reflect the revenue recognition model in IFRS 15. B23.5 In FRED 82 the FRC proposed making amendments to Section 23 of FRS 102 that were based on IASB/ED/2022/1 Draft third edition of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, but with adaptations: intended to allow, but not require, an entity applying FRS 102 to have accounting policies that are equivalent to those that would meet the requirements of IFRS 15; and to address matters relevant to the fact that FRS 102 is applied by a broader group of entities compared to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. B23.6 Most respondents were in favour of the proposal to introduce the five-step revenue recognition model from IFRS 15. Many respondents thought that certain requirements should be more closely aligned with the requirements of IFRS 15 (and therefore may diverge from the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard). B23.7 FRS 102 aims to be simpler than IFRS Accounting Standards. Therefore, Section 23 is clearly structured around the five-step revenue recognition model in IFRS 15; includes a more straightforward description of the requirements for licensing; and includes a rewording of the constraint on estimates of variable consideration in the positive so it is easier to understand
