Such timing differences may arise, for example, where there are undistributed profits in a subsidiary, associate, branch or interest in a joint venture. Permanent differences Permanent differences arise because certain types of income and expenses are non-taxable or disallowable, or because certain tax charges or allowances are greater or smaller than the corresponding income or expense in the financial statements.
