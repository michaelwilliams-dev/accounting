auditors feeling tired and overworked. “It's busy the whole year [...] with the [focus on the] quality side has come this huge pressure. More forms, more procedures, more people to review your work. Recruitment is a challenge, head count is low…if we get [documents from the audited entity] late, we fall into the trap of thinking it's too late to make a challenge.” (Senior manager / Director) Limited repercussions for the audited entity Many auditors and partners also felt that the audited entity is not sufficiently reprimanded or implicated when an audit is rated as poor quality by the FRC. This is felt to perpetuate the cycle of audited entities delivering late or poor-quality documents, auditors’ workloads increasing within the same timelines, auditors feeling pressure and ultimately either rushing tasks or working long hours which in turn means that scepticism and challenge are more likely to be sacrificed. Implications: How the regulator can drive professional scepticism and effective challenge Via greater direction and clarity around what the FRC expect out of documentation Clearer guidance on documentation requirements around scepticism and challenge, including highlighting how documents should be completed as well as what areas auditors should be prioritising and focusing on, would help auditors complete them to a higher standard. Within this, the use of examples and case studies would be most useful, demonstrating to auditors and partners what the FRC would expect out of real-world scenarios, so they feel more able to apply this in their own work. By recognising the role of the audited entity during audit quality reviews When conducting auditor quality reviews, the FRC could include reflections on what part, if any, the audited entity might have played in leading to a poor-quality audit (e.g. delivering late documentation). This could help take some onus away from the
