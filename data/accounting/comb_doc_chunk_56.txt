value recognised in profit or loss. Under the fair value model (option (b)), FRS 102 previously allowed an undue cost or effort exemption whereby when it is impracticable to measure fair value, cost could be used instead. This has exemption has been removed. On transition If an entity has previously used the undue cost or effort exemption in relation to investments in associates or joint ventures measured under the fair value model, it can simply change its accounting policy and opt to use the cost model going forward. Amendments to Section 16 Investment Property Investment property rented to a third party Previously, entities were required to measure all investment property at fair value unless the fair value cannot be determined without undue cost or effort, in which case it is measured at cost less depreciation and impairment, until such time that a reliable measure of fair value can be determined. This undue cost or effort exemption has been removed and all investment properties rented to a third party will need to be measured at fair value. On transition An entity that has investment property rented to a third party measured at cost will need to determine a fair value for these properties using the guidance set out in the Appendix to Section 2 Fair Value Measurement. The Appendix to Section 2 does allow for situations when a reliable fair value cannot be determined, however, we would expect these situations to be extremely rare. Investment property rented to another group entity To address a significant implementation issue, Section 16 was amended to introduce an accounting policy option in respect of investment property rented to another group entity whereby entities may elect to transfer these properties to property, plant and equipment and measure them at cost (less depreciation and impairment) under Section
