inappropriate unless it reflects the contractual position. IG2.4 Written premiums should include an estimate for pipeline premiums relating only to those underlying contracts of insurance where the period of cover has commenced prior to the reporting date. IG2.5 Where an insurer has offered renewal and is therefore contractually liable to pay claims if renewal is subsequently confirmed by the policyholder, it should recognise the renewal premium in income, subject to making a provision for anticipated lapses and the necessary proportion of unearned premiums. IG2.6 Under some policies written premiums may be adjusted retrospectively in the light of claims experience or where the risk covered cannot be assessed accurately at the commencement of cover. Where written premiums are subject to an increase retrospectively, recognition of potential increases should be deferred until the additional amount can be ascertained with reasonable certainty. Where written premiums are subject to a reduction, a remeasurement taking account of such a reduction should be made as soon as the entity has an obligation to the policyholder. IG2.7 Additional or return premiums should be treated as a remeasurement of the initial premium. Where a claims event causes a reinstatement premium to be paid, the recognition of the reinstatement premium and the effect on the initial premium should reflect the respective incidence of risk attaching to those premiums in determining under the annual accounting basis that proportion earned and unearned at the reporting date. IG2.8 Written premiums should be recognised as earned premiums over the period of the policy having regard to the incidence of risk. Time apportionment of the premium is normally appropriate if the incidence of risk is the same throughout the period of cover. If there is a marked unevenness in the incidence of risk over the period of cover, a basis which reflects the profile
