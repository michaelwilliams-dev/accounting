The cash flow hedge reserve moves from (CU129,000) to (CU130,000), a change of (CU1,000). In accordance with paragraph 12.23(b), the loss of CU1,000 on the interest rate swap is recognised in other comprehensive income. The fixed interest element on the hypothetical swap is CU430,000, whilst the variable rate component is CU300,000. The variability of the 3-month IBOR affects profit or loss during the period by (CU130,000). Accordingly, the reclassification adjustment in accordance with paragraph 12.23(d)(ii) is (CU130,000).
