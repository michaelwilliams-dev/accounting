For inventories with a different nature or use, different cost formulas may be justified. The last-in, first-out method (LIFO) is not permitted by this FRS. Impairment of inventories Paragraphs 27.2 to 27.4 require an entity to assess at the end of each reporting period whether any inventories are impaired, ie the carrying amount is not fully recoverable (eg because of damage, obsolescence or declining selling prices). If an item (or group of items) of inventory is impaired, those paragraphs require the entity to measure the inventory at its selling price less costs to complete and sell, and to recognise an impairment loss. Those paragraphs also require a reversal of a prior impairment in some circumstances. Recognition as an expense When inventories are sold, the entity shall recognise the carrying amount of those inventories as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognised. A When inventories held for distribution at no or nominal consideration are distributed, the carrying amount of those inventories shall be recognised as an expense. Some inventories may be allocated to other asset accounts, for example, inventory used as a component of self-constructed property, plant or equipment. Inventories allocated to another asset in this way are accounted for subsequently in accordance with the section of this FRS relevant to that type of asset. Disclosures An entity shall disclose the following: the accounting policies adopted in measuring inventories, including the cost formula used; the total carrying amount of inventories and the carrying amount in classifications appropriate to the entity; [Deleted] impairment losses recognised or reversed in profit or loss in accordance with Section 27 Impairment of Assets; and * (e) the total carrying amount of inventories pledged as security for liabilities.
