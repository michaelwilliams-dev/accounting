£540 Direct cost of materials used £240 Amount deducted £90 Example D6 The following is an example of a calculation where materials as well as labour are supplied (‘supply and fix’). Where the subcontractor is registered for VAT, any VAT they had to pay on materials should be excluded in the cost of materials when calculating the CIS deduction. For the total cost of £600 a subcontractor, who is a taxable person for VAT purposes, agrees to paint the interior of a building and to supply the materials. The painter pays £240 for the materials, which includes VAT of £40. Labour charge £400 Materials £200 Total payment £600 Add VAT £120 Amount due (invoice amount) £720 Calculation of deduction Total payment (exclusive of VAT) £600 Less cost of materials (exclusive of VAT) £200 Amount liable to deduction £400 Amount deducted at 30% £120 Net payment to subcontractor £585 The subcontractor is paid £600, which is the invoice amount (£720) less the deduction (£120).
