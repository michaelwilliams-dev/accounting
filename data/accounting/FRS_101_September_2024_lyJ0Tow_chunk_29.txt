markets must also be disclosed. Although this FRS provides an exemption from paragraph 114 of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the requirements of the Regulations shall still be complied with. Realised profits A2.12 Paragraph 13(a) of Schedule 1 to the Regulations requires that only profits realised at the balance sheet date are included in the profit and loss account. A2.13 Paragraph 39 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations allows stocks, investment property and living animals and plants to be held at fair value in Companies Act accounts. A2.14 Paragraph 40(2) of Schedule 1 to the Regulations then requires that movements in the value of financial instruments, investment properties or living animals or plants are recognised in the profit and loss account, notwithstanding the usual restrictions allowing only realised profits and losses to be included in the profit and loss account. Paragraph 40 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations thereby overrides the requirements of Paragraph 13(a) of Schedule 1. A2.15 Entities measuring investment properties, living animals or plants, or financial instruments at fair value should note that they may transfer such amounts to a separate non-distributable reserve instead of carrying them forward in retained earnings but are not required to do so. Presenting fair value movements that are not distributable profits in a separate reserve may assist with the identification of profits available for that purpose. A2.16 Entities should also continue to note that whether profits are available for distribution must be determined in accordance with applicable law. Entities may also refer to the Technical Release 02/17BL Guidance on Realised and Distributable Profits under the Companies Act 2006 issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland or any successor document, to determine profits available for distribution.
