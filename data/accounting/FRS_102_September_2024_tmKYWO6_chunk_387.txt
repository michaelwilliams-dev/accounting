purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, no additional liabilities shall be recognised in respect of an agreement with the defined benefit plan to fund a deficit (such as a schedule of contributions). Inclusion of both vested and unvested benefits The present value of an entity’s obligations under defined benefit plans at the reporting date shall reflect the estimated amount of benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, including benefits that are not yet vested (see paragraph 28.26) and including the effects of benefit formulas that give employees greater benefits for later years of service. This requires the entity to determine how much benefit is attributable to the current and prior periods on the basis of the plan’s benefit formula and to make estimates (actuarial assumptions) about demographic variables (such as employee turnover and mortality) and financial variables (such as future increases in salaries and medical costs) that influence the cost of the benefit. The actuarial assumptions shall be unbiased (neither imprudent nor excessively conservative), mutually compatible, and selected to lead to the best estimate of the future cash flows that will arise under the plan. Discounting An entity shall measure its defined benefit obligation on a discounted present value basis. The entity shall determine the rate used to discount the future payments by reference to market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds. In countries with no deep market in such bonds, the entity shall use the market yields (at the reporting date) on national government bonds. The currency and term of the corporate bonds or national government bonds shall be consistent with the currency and estimated period of the future payments. Actuarial valuation method An entity shall use the projected unit credit method to measure its defined
