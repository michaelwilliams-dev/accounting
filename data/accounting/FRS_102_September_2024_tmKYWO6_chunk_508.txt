Disclosure is required of reconciliation between amounts presented in the statement of financial position (ie cash) and ‘cash and cash equivalents’. 69 This would also include entities in which a company has at least a 20 per cent holding, but which are not a subsidiary, joint venture or an associate. A shareholding of 20 per cent is presumed to give significant influence to the holder, such that the investment would be classified as an associate, therefore in practice there are unlikely to be many related undertakings that are not subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates. Appendix III Note on legal requirements Introduction A3.1 This appendix provides an overview of how the requirements in FRS 102 address United Kingdom company law requirements. It is therefore written from the perspective of a company to which the Companies Act 2006 applies.70 Appendix IV discusses the Republic of Ireland legal references. A3.2 Many entities that are not constituted as companies apply accounting standards promulgated by the FRC for the purposes of preparing financial statements that present a true and fair view71. A brief consideration of the legal framework for some other entities can be found at A3.41 and A3.42.
