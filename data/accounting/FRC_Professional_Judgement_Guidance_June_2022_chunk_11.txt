1, professional judgement is exercised whenever the auditor makes an informed decision about the appropriate course of action in their role as an auditor. As mentioned in the introduction, such decisions will vary with respect to the extent to which a formal and considered judgement process is warranted; it is not expected that the professional judgement process presented here will be followed for every professional judgement made by an auditor. In general, the auditor may wish to consider the complexity and importance of the judgement being made, their experience at making similar judgements and the availability of any direct precedents, in deciding whether to use a formal judgement process. Consider who is the right person to make this judgement Having the right person or people making a judgement goes a long way to ensuring an appropriate conclusion is reached. When assessing who is the right person or people to make the judgement, the auditor considers: The relevant knowledge, skills and experience required; The complexity and importance of the judgement; and, The time and resources that would be available to them, including access to coaching, technical advisory services provided by the firm, external experts, training materials and automated tools and techniques. Where the auditor engages an expert to provide a view on a certain topic, as part of a professional judgement process, it is important to note that the auditor remains responsible for the relevant professional judgement; the expert may provide information to support the making of a judgement, but the judgement itself cannot be delegated to them.9 International Standard on Auditing (UK) 220 (Revised July 2021), Quality Management for an Audit of Financial Statements and International Standard on Auditing (UK) 620 (Revised November 2019), Using the Work of an Auditor’s Expert contain requirements relating to the use of auditor’s experts.
