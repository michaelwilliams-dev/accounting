may then be carried out up to the value of that standing approval (subject to the application of the non-audit services fee cap, as explained below). If subsequent changes to the cost and/or scope of restructuring services cause the fees to exceed this pre-approval threshold, the auditor needs to gain prior approval, from the audit committee, to allow the services to continue to be provided. 3 A rule of thumb that a holding of more than 20 per cent will be considered to give rise to significant influence may be helpfully adopted. 4 PIE audit committees have told us that they also consider a range of broader measures including their assessment of the auditor’s approach to the provision of non-audit services; and the scale of the PIE’s participation in the syndicate. The non-audit services fee cap The EU Audit Regulation and the FRC’s Ethical Standard (see Appendix 1) set out a non- audit services fee cap applicable to PIEs. Where the audit committee has determined that a service received is trivial, then the committee’s standing procedures may suggest that a standard ‘deemed’ amount be used for the value of the service provided for the purposes of monitoring against the non-audit services fee cap. This deemed amount should be consistent with the audit committee’s assessment of what is trivial for the purposes of being approved through a standing procedure. Impact of syndicate changes In reality, lending syndicates operate with a flexible membership and the share of debt held by each participant is subject to ongoing change. If such a change arises after the provision of the restructuring services has commenced, that results, for example, in a change in the nature or circumstances of the engagement, such that an objective, reasonable and informed third party would consider the changed circumstances poses a
