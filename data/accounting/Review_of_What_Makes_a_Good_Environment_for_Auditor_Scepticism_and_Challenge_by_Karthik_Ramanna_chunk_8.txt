professional advancement. Finally, it is perhaps time for audit-firms’ leadership to re- evaluate the level and determinants of middle management pay. While firms should be careful to avoid a purely transactional culture – where audit quality is not valued for its own sake, and rank-and-file auditors simply provide challenge to earn bonus points – there does appear to be a case to provide more fulfilling working conditions for mid-level auditors. Unlike junior auditors who have not “sunk” much time into the profession, and audit partners who enjoy more security of tenure, mid-level auditors are vulnerable to unintentional exploitation by the system. Notwithstanding the above, my own judgement is that the biggest cultural impediment to client challenge in audit firms is not personnel-related but rather structural to the industry: this impediment arises from the perception that the client company’s executive management (particularly the CFO) is the embodiment of the client itself. This perception reflects the reality that client CFOs generally commission audits and determine audit compensation. Essentially, it is the “fox” who is commissioning the evaluation of henhouse security, so auditors are wary of being seen as hostile to foxes. This is a situation that the FRC can seek to remedy by forbidding involvement of client executive-management in audit appointment, retention, and compensation decisions: requiring instead that these decisions are vested in the non-executive members of the client’s board, especially its audit committee. Of course, such a move would be a significant departure from current corporate governance practice, and it would necessitate substantial changes to the audit committee, as I describe later. Audit processes: I have already alluded earlier to the byzantine nature of the modern audit, with its many checklists and mind-numbing forms. Audit firms themselves have little direct control over these processes, as they are the consequence of ever
