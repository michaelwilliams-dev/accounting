Please see earlier footnotes for further detail. As we set out in our competition policy paper13, while there are many audit firms active in the PIE audit market, many of these firms supply only a few PIE audits. In 2022, only 13 of the 42 audit firms active in the PIE audit market supplied more than 10 PIE audits.14 Over the last four years, there has been an increase in the number of audit firms auditing FTSE 350 companies as well as other listed equity (from 24 firms in 2019 to 33 firms in 2022)15.
