an employee is no longer employed (such as an illness), an obligation is created when the employee renders service that will provide entitlement to the benefit if the specified event occurs. The probability that the specified event will occur affects the measurement of the obligation, but does not determine whether the obligation exists. If defined benefits are reduced for amounts that will be paid to employees under government-sponsored plans, an entity shall measure its defined benefit obligations on a basis that reflects the benefits payable under the government plans, but only if: those plans were enacted before the reporting date; or past history, or other reliable evidence, indicates that those state benefits will change in some predictable manner, for example, in line with future changes in general price levels or general salary levels. Reimbursements If an entity is virtually certain that another party will reimburse some or all of the expenditure required to settle a defined benefit obligation, the entity shall recognise its right to reimbursement as a separate asset. An entity shall treat that asset in the same way as plan assets. The cost of a defined benefit plan recognised in accordance with paragraph 28.23 may be presented net of the amounts relating to changes in the carrying amount of the right to reimbursement. Other long-term employee benefits Other long-term employee benefits include items such as the following, if not expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the related service: long-term paid absences such as long-service or sabbatical leave; other long-service benefits; long-term disability benefits; profit-sharing and bonuses; and deferred remuneration. An entity shall recognise a liability for other long-term employee benefits measured at the net total of the following amounts: the present value of
