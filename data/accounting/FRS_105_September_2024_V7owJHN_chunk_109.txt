impairment loss shall be reversed in a subsequent period. A micro-entity shall assess at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased. Indications that an impairment loss may have decreased or may no longer exist are generally the opposite of those set out in paragraph 22.7. If any such indication exists, the micro-entity shall determine whether all or part of the prior impairment loss should be reversed. Reversal where recoverable amount was estimated for an individual impaired asset When the prior impairment loss was based on the recoverable amount of the individual impaired asset, the following requirements apply: The micro-entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset at the current reporting date. If the estimated recoverable amount of the asset exceeds its carrying amount, the micro-entity shall increase the carrying amount to recoverable amount, subject to the limitation described in paragraph (c) below. That increase is a reversal of an impairment loss. The micro-entity shall recognise the reversal immediately in profit or loss. The reversal of an impairment loss shall not increase the carrying amount of the asset above the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. After a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised, the micro-entity shall adjust the depreciation (amortisation) charge for the asset in future periods to allocate the assetâ€™s revised carrying amount, less its residual value (if any), on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life. Disclosures An Irish micro-entity shall disclose information in relation to impairment losses recognised and reversed in accordance with Appendix B to Section 6 Notes to the Financial Statements.
