Contractors do not need to show this reference on monthly returns or subcontractors’ payment statements where deductions have been made at the standard rate or where the subcontractor has been paid gross.

We’ll also contact all contractors who have verified or used the subcontractor in the current or previous 2 tax years. We’ll give contractors 35 days’ notice of the change. Payments they make to the subcontractor after the notified date of change must be made under deduction. If the subcontractor’s recent invoice has already been processed in the contractor’s accounting system we would not expect the contractor to reprocess it if it’s diﬃcult or time consuming, but would expect the change to be applied to the next payment. Sometimes a subcontractor’s payment status will change from payment under deduction to gross payment. If this happens, we’ll tell the subcontractor and any contractors who have verified or used the subcontractor in the current or previous 2 tax years. The revised payment status should then be applied to all subsequent payments to
