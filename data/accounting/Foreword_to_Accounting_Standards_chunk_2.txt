companies these are referred to in the Act as ‘IAS accounts’ and in Irish company law as ‘IFRS ﬁnancial statements’). Scope of accounting standards Directors of companies incorporated under either the Act, or the Companies Act 2014, are required by legislation to prepare ﬁnancial statements that give a true and fair view of: the assets, liabilities and ﬁnancial position of the company and, where relevant, the group at the end of the reporting period; and the proﬁt or loss of the company and, where relevant, the group for the reporting period. In the case of a micro-entity, ﬁnancial statements drawn up in accordance with the micro-entity provisions of company law are presumed to give a true and fair view. Accounting standards are applicable to the ﬁnancial statements of a reporting entity1 that are required to give a true and fair view of its ﬁnancial position at the reporting date and of its proﬁt or loss (or income and expenditure) for the reporting period. The whole essence of accounting standards is to provide for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure for speciﬁc aspects of ﬁnancial reporting in a way that reﬂects economic reality and hence provides a true and fair view. More information about the ‘true and fair’ concept can be found on the FRC website.
