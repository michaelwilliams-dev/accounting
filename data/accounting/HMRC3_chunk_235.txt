to the appointment and dismissal of auditors, signature of auditors� reports and disclosure of auditors� remuneration equivalent to the requirements on companies. 9. 16.8 Di?erences in how these requirements apply for any specific types of qualifying partnership Some qualifying partnerships that are limited partnerships are now registered as Tax Transparent Funds, with some di?erences in their Companies House registration. These partnerships also have a separate registration at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as a specific form of UCITS (�Undertaking for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities�). Other qualifying partnerships are Alternative Investment Funds, which also have a separate registration at the Financial Conduct Authority. Much of the material prepared as part of the accounts and reports of qualifying partnerships in line with the Companies Act 2006 will also be suitable for filing with the FCA to fulfil its filing requirements for UCITS and AIFs. For filing with the FCA, qualifying partnerships that are registered as UCITS or AIFs must comply with FCA guidance. 17. Community interest companies (CICs) CICs are no di?erent from other companies when it comes to preparing and filing accounts. But they must file their accounts along with a copy of the CIC report. All CICs must prepare and deliver a CIC report (CIC34) to Companies House. It must be made up to the same date as the accounts. You must send a fee of �15 with the CIC report. Please make cheques payable to �Companies House�. You must prepare and deliver the report regardless of the size of the company, or any accounts exemptions.
