the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option (assessed considering the factors described in paragraphs 20.41 to 20.44); and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. In-substance fixed lease payments are payments that may, in form, contain variability, but that, in substance, are unavoidable. Such payments exist, for example, if: there is no genuine variability, for example payments that must be made only if an asset is proven to be capable of operating during the lease, or only if an event occurs that has no genuine possibility of not occurring; or payments that are initially structured as variable lease payments linked to the use of the underlying asset but for which the variability will be resolved at some point after the commencement date so that the payments become fixed for the remainder of the lease term. Those payments become in-substance fixed payments when the variability is resolved; there is more than one set of payments that could be made, but only one of these sets is realistic; or there is more than one realistic set of payments that could be made, but one of these sets must be paid. In this case, the set of payments with the lowest discounted amount shall be selected. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate described in paragraph 20.51 include, for example, payments linked to a consumer price index, payments linked to a benchmark interest rate or payments that vary to reflect changes in market rents. The index or rate at the commencement date is that assessed under the terms of the contract at that date. It shall not reflect, and shall not contain any assumptions about, changes to the index or rate after the
