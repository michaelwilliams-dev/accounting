the special rate pool. If the value totals �100,000 or less, put the costs in the main rate pool unless there�s another factor that would qualify it as special rate - for example, it�s an integral feature. This �100,000 limit is adjusted if your accounting period is more or less than 12 months. For example, if your accounting period is 9 months the limit will be 9/12 x �100,000 = �75,000. If you�re in a partnership where one or more of the members is a limited company (not an individual), put all costs of long-life items in the special rate pool. Single asset pools You might need to create one or more separate pools for single assets that: have a short life (for assets you�re not going to keep for a long time) you use outside your business if you�re a sole trader or in a partnership Short life assets It�s up to you to decide whether you want to treat something as a short life asset. You cannot include: cars items you also use outside your business special rate items Large numbers of very similar items can be pooled together (for example, crockery in a restaurant). The pool ends when you sell the asset. This means you can claim the capital allowances over a shorter period. Move the balance into your main pool in your next accounting period or tax year if you�re still using the item after 8 years. Let HMRC know Let HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) know on your tax return if you�re a limited company and you decide to create a short life asset pool. You must do this within 2 years of the end of the tax year when you bought the item. Let HMRC know in writing if you�re a sole trader or
