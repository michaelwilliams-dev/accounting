Scheme (CIS) Under the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS), contractors deduct money from a subcontractor�s payments and pass it to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The deductions count as advance payments towards the subcontractor�s tax and National Insurance. Contractors must register for the scheme. Subcontractors do not have to register, but deductions are taken from their payments at a higher rate if they�re not registered. If you�re already registered as a contractor, you can sign in to CIS online to file your monthly returns or to verify a subcontractor. Who counts as a contractor or subcontractor Register as a contractor if either: you pay subcontractors for construction work your business does not do construction work but you have spent more than �3 million on construction in the 12 months since you made your first payment Register as a subcontractor if you do construction work for a contractor. You must register as both if you fall under both categories.
