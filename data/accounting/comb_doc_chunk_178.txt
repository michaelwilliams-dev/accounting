transactions for more detail on this topic. Examples Examples 1 to 5 in this Education Note relate to entities which have a 31 December 2015 year end and prepare their first set of financial statements that are compliant with FRS 102 as at that date. Their date of transition to FRS 102 is 1 January 2014. Example 1 Accounting estimates At 31 December 2013, Entity A had a debtor balance of CU500. At 31 December 2013 Entity A was concerned about the credit risk of the debtor and was in discussion with the debtor as to how the debt might be settled. As a consequence Entity A had made a provision of CU250, ie for 50 per cent of the balance as at that date. During 2014 the debtor collapsed and was liquidated. When Entity A prepares its opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2014 in accordance with FRS 102 it no longer believes it will collect any of the outstanding debt. However, Entity A does not revise its previous estimate taking into account hindsight for preparing its opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2014, because paragraph 35.9(c) of FRS 102 prohibits retrospective adjustments to accounting estimates on the date of transition. Example 2 Business combination before the date of transition On 1 January 2010, Entity B acquired a wholly owned subsidiary and applied the requirements of FRS 6 Acquisitions and Mergers and FRS 7 Fair Values in Acquisition Accounting. In accordance with these FRSs, Entity B recognised the following opening fair values in its consolidated financial statements: Entity B did not recognise deferred tax in respect of any of the fair value adjustments made on acquisition.
