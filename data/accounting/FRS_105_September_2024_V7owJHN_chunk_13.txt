derecognising any assets or liabilities (components) that have expired or have been consumed, collected, fulfilled or transferred (collectively, the transferred components), and recognising, and presenting separately in the income statement, any resulting income and expenses; and continuing to recognise, and presenting separately in the statement of financial position, any retained assets or liabilities (the retained component). Measurement Measurement at initial recognition At initial recognition, a micro-entity shall measure assets and liabilities at cost. Under limited circumstances this FRS requires a micro-entity to estimate the cost of an asset or liability based on its fair value. When this FRS requires a micro-entity to determine the fair value of an asset or liability, a micro-entity shall use the following methodology to estimate the fair value: The best evidence of fair value is an unadjusted quoted price for an identical or comparable asset or liability in an active market. When an unadjusted quoted price is not available, the price of a recent orderly transaction between market participants for an identical or comparable asset or liability provides evidence of fair value. However, this price may not be a reliable estimate of fair value if there has been a significant change in economic circumstances or a significant period of time between the date of the transaction, and the measurement date. If neither (a) nor (b) above are available or reliable, the fair value shall be estimated using another valuation technique. The objective of using another valuation technique is to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell an asset or to transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date. Subsequent measurement Financial assets and financial liabilities A micro-entity measures financial assets and financial liabilities as follows: Investments in preference shares or ordinary shares and investments in subsidiaries and
