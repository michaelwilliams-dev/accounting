102, but there is no conceptual difference between the two. However, in practice many UK reporting entities do not provide for holiday pay (short-term compensated absences) and will need to consider this when applying FRS 102 for the first time. Example 1 Employees of Company A are permitted 24 days annual leave which must be taken in the holiday year which commences on 1 April. Company A’s financial year end is 31 December. At 31 December an employee, pro-rata is entitled to have taken 18 days holiday. Company A calculates from holiday records that outstanding holiday (ie holiday not taken from an allowance of 18 days) is 56 days for all employees at the same grade. Company A considers that it is appropriate to make an accrual for the 56 days outstanding holiday measured at the average salary per day. Overall impact On the date of transition to FRS 102, a new provision would be recognised for short-term employee benefits with a corresponding adjustment to opening retained earnings. In future years, assuming the annual holiday allowance, the pattern of holidays taken and holiday year remain constant, the movement in the provision from one year to the next will probably be limited.
