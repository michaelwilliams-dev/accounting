the audit work. Assurance for an area can be fragmented and scattered across the audit file. Care needs to be taken to ensure this does not prevent a proper and holistic assessment of the audit findings. Sometimes it will be necessary for discrete tests to be performed. There needs to be a stand back mechanism built into the audit so the outputs from these discrete tests can be looked at in the context of the overall business model and circumstances of the entity. This approach ensures the team can identify contradictory results. This consideration needs to be reflected in the audit team’s recording of reasoning and supported by appropriate cross referencing. There are some specific aspects of execution that can be particularly challenging, but where we have nonetheless seen examples of good practice. These are explored in more detail in the following sections. Execution – Professional scepticism and challenge of management Auditors must ‘stand back’ and evaluate the overall audit evidence obtained. Recent revisions to various ISAs (UK) have included specific requirements1. Professional scepticism must be exercised across the entire audit, although it may be particularly apparent when assessing management’s judgements and estimates. Audit procedures should be performed in a manner that is not biased towards obtaining audit evidence that may be corroborative or towards excluding audit evidence that may be contradictory. The auditors must consult appropriately when carrying out the audit of complex areas. They should persist in challenging management if management do not address the auditor’s concerns. Those charged with governance also have a part to play in challenging management. Auditors must also challenge management where the auditor considers that management should be using its own experts to support specific disclosures in the accounts. Relevant matters must always be brought to the attention of those charged with governance.
