are doing differently, are often unable to replicate their competitors’ cultural successes. This is the problem of replicating “relational contracts” of other firms. Consider the famous case study of the Andon cord in the Toyota assembly line. This cord plays a special role in Toyota’s famed reliability-at-cost model. Rank-and-file workers on the Toyota assembly line are encouraged to pull the Andon cord (a sort-of lantern) when they notice a possible manufacturing defect on the line, effectively stopping the entire production process at great expense. There are no explicit rules on when to pull the cord and when not to – if it were possible to specify such rules, then the cord itself would be unnecessary, and low-cost reliability would not be as elusive as it is. Instead, employees are, over time and on-the-job, trained in the “good judgement” of when to pull the cord. If they are too prudent in pulling the cord, quality will suffer; if they are too liberal, cost will suffer. They must also believe that Toyota’s management will trust them to exercise that judgement wisely; so that if they make a mistake (whether a Type I or Type II error1) and that mistake is not intentional, management will not punish them. But management cannot give them any such explicit assurance, because if it does, the quality of worker judgement in deciding whether to pull the cord (the vaunted discerning nature) will suffer. Thus, the whole system relies on an implicit relational contract between management and line workers at Toyota. Other car companies have tried for years to copy the Toyota system, knowing full well what it entails. But they have not succeeded. Because the culture of challenge embodied in the Andon cord system at Toyota cannot be codified. This is analogous to the issue every audit
