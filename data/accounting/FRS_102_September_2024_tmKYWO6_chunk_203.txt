future cash flows will be based. Group of items 12.25R When an entity applies paragraph 12.25J to a hedged item that is a group of items (see paragraph 12.16B), the entity shall allocate the items in that group to subgroups based on the benchmark rate being hedged and document the benchmark rate as the hedged risk for each subgroup. For example, in a hedging relationship in which a group of items is hedged for changes in an interest rate benchmark subject to interest rate benchmark reform, the hedged cash flows or fair value of some items in the group could be changed to reference an alternative benchmark rate before other items in the group are changed. In this example, in applying paragraph 12.25J, the entity would document the alternative benchmark rate as the hedged risk for that relevant subgroup of hedged items. The entity would continue to document the existing interest rate benchmark as the hedged risk for the other subgroup of hedged items until the hedged cash flows or fair value of those items are changed to reference the alternative benchmark rate or the items expire and are replaced with hedged items that reference the alternative benchmark rate. 12.25S An entity applying paragraph 12.25R shall assess separately whether each subgroup meets the requirements in paragraph 12.16B. If any subgroup fails to meet the requirements in paragraph 12.16B, the entity shall discontinue hedge accounting prospectively for the hedging relationship in its entirety. An entity shall also apply the requirements in paragraphs 12.20 or 12.23 to account for ineffectiveness related to the hedging relationship in its entirety. Components of an item 12.25T For the purposes of applying paragraph 12.16C(a), an alternative benchmark rate that is a non-contractually specified risk component, which is not separately identifiable, is deemed to be separately identifiable,
