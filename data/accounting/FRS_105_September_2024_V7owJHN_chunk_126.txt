except that no adjustment shall be made to the carrying amount of goodwill; if goodwill has previously been determined to have an indefinite useful life, it shall be re-assessed to determine its remaining useful life and shall subsequently be measured in accordance with paragraph 14.2. Share-based payment transactions A first-time adopter is not required to apply Section 21 Share-based Payment to obligations arising from share-based payment transactions that were settled before the date of transition to this FRS. Investment properties A first-time adopter is not required to retrospectively apply paragraph 12.15 to determine the depreciated cost of each of the major components of an investment property at the date of transition to this FRS. If this exemption is applied, a first-time adopter shall: Determine the total cost of the investment property including all of its components. Where no depreciation had been charged under the micro-entityâ€™s previous financial reporting framework, this can be calculated by reversing any revaluation gains or losses previously recognised in equity reserves. The cost of land, if any, shall be separated from buildings. Estimate the total depreciated cost of the investment property (excluding land) at the date of transition to this FRS, by recognising accumulated depreciation since the date of initial acquisition calculated on the basis of the useful life of the most significant component of the item of investment property (eg the main structural elements of the building). A portion of the estimated total depreciated cost calculated in paragraph (iii) shall then be allocated to each of the other major components (ie excluding the most significant component identified above) to determine their depreciated cost. The allocation should be made on a reasonable and consistent basis. For example, a possible basis of allocation is to multiply the current cost to replace the component by the ratio of
