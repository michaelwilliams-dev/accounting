bank lending or bond funded syndicates (“lending syndicates”) in which one or more Public Interest Entities (PIEs) audited by the auditor participate (“participating PIE”). It sets out the FRC’s consideration of the application in practice of the main, relevant requirements in the EU Audit Regulation and the FRC’s Ethical Standard. This is a complex area, and the FRC has developed this guidance after careful consideration. It is important that in applying this guidance, auditors keep in mind that the compliance and ethical assessments they need to make require the exercise of careful judgement. In making an assessment, the auditor draws on their own experience and understanding of the services to be provided and of the participating entities, but ultimately reflects on how an objective, reasonable and informed third party1 would view matters.

The auditor needs to consider whether a (non–audit) service is provided to the PIE (paragraph 4); whether any service is prohibited (paragraphs 5-7); threats to auditor independence (paragraphs 8-11); approval of the services (paragraphs 12-15); and the application of the non-audit services fee cap (paragraphs 15-16). To whom are the restructuring services provided? Determining whether the restructuring services provided to a lending syndicate, are in fact provided to each of the participant PIEs requires the careful application of judgment to the specific facts and circumstances. The FRC is aware of a number of potential indicators which the auditor and the participating PIE audit committee use as a suitable proxy to assess to whom the restructuring services are provided. These indicators include whether an entity: is party to an engagement; has signed a letter of engagement; is an addressee
