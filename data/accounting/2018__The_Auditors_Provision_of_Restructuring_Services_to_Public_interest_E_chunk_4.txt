either as the agent or a member of the steering committee of a lending syndicate or is able to exert significant influence by virtue of its share of the debt held.3 We believe the consideration of risks to independence outlined above to be consistent with the approach taken by other international regulators in similar circumstances. Approval of services The auditor will also need to determine what approvals are necessary, and from whom, to be able to provide restructuring services to the participating PIE. Where the service being provided is trivial, it can be approved through a standing procedure established by the PIE’s audit committee. Where the service provided is not trivial, specific pre-approval by the PIE’s audit committee is required. In making an assessment, on a case by case basis, of whether or not the restructuring services to be provided are trivial, the primary consideration will be whether the fee for the service provided is trivial in the context of the PIE’s financial statements. Triviality will be a matter for the judgment of the auditor, and of the audit committee, in both quantitative and qualitative terms.4 There is no basis set out in law as to how to assess the quantum of fees for the restructuring services attributable to a participating PIE. Existing market practice suggests that where non-audit fee disclosures are given the bases used include: the proportion of the total fee for the restructuring services provided to the lending syndicate as a whole is pro-rated to reflect the percentage of the syndicate’s debt held by the participating PIE; the actual payments made, or agreed to be made, for the restructuring services either by the lending syndicate as a whole or by the participating PIE. Where the provision of the restructuring services is approved through a standing procedure, work
