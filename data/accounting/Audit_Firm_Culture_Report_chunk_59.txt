isolated or working more independently. One example of this, as referenced in an earlier chapter, is juniors being more likely to email rather than pick up the phone, demonstrating a perceived lack of confidence in communicating. In addition, poor embedding of new, hybrid ways of working was also felt to have changed the way in which more junior auditors work, in turn impairing their ability to learn on the job. For instance, some pointed out that junior auditors are less able to learn ‘by osmosis’ because they have been physically removed from their colleagues due to remote or hybrid working and are less tuned into the benefit of overhearing internal and external engagements from which they might learn. A small number also felt that junior colleagues were less familiar with working collaboratively and as part of a team, which had led to them checking in or raising questions with their senior colleagues less frequently. “Learning by osmosis has depleted […] Many of the benefits to on site, boardroom or contact with team learning [have been lost].” (Senior manager / Director) “Getting back into the office more will help. At the moment they have to ring and ask questions, so they ask questions less and leave them until later in the day.” (Assistant manager / Manager) The shift towards virtual training impacting on the quality of formal training Several junior auditors felt that more could be done to make training on scepticism and challenge more effective and engaging. There was a feeling that delivering virtual training sessions in lengthy, lecture-style formats can be ineffective as auditors struggle to maintain attention and admit to disengaging by turning off their webcams to carry out other work at the same time. This is perceived to be particularly common during busy periods when auditors feel
