and remove the effects of conditions in the historical period that do not exist currently. It may not be sufficient to only use days past due to calculate bad debt provisions (ie impairment losses on trade debtors). It is likely that the debtors will need to be stratified by more than just days past due, in order to reflect other credit risk characteristics, and the formula needs to reflect actual experience of delinquency, which is expected to continue. Such formulae would need to be kept under active review, and reflect changes in credit risk characteristics, such as a change in the customer base, not just historical loss experience. Example A furniture retailer which has a small chain of stores, offers extended credit terms for purchases over Â£2,000. In the vicinity of one store, a significant local employer announces redundancies amounting to approximately 20% of its staff. The manager of this store estimates that 40% of its debtors are currently employed by this employer, and therefore it might be expected that 8% (20% of 40%) of the debtors may lose their jobs. Using observable data about the likely extent of default to measure the amount of the impairment (for example, historical evidence from a previous period of higher unemployment), the furniture retailer should estimate and recognise an impairment loss for the group of financial assets relating to the people employed by this particular local employer. If there is observable data that job losses at this employer have a knock-on effect on the local economy as a whole, the impact should be considered separately. The furniture retailer should not apply this impairment to all debtors as they do not share the same credit risk characteristics of this sub-group.
