The historical cost of a liability when it is incurred or taken on is the value of the consideration received to incur or take on the liability minus transaction costs. The historical cost of an asset is updated over time to depict, if applicable: the consumption of part or all of the economic resource that constitutes the asset (depreciation or amortisation); payments received that extinguish part or all of the asset; the effect of events that cause part or all of the historical cost of the asset to be no longer recoverable (impairment); and accrual of interest to reflect any financing component of the asset. The historical cost of a liability is updated over time to depict, if applicable: fulfilment of part or all of the liability, for example, by making payments that extinguish part or all of the liability or by satisfying an obligation to deliver goods; the effect of events that increase the value of the obligation to transfer the economic resources needed to fulfil the liability to such an extent that the liability becomes onerous. A liability is onerous if the historical cost is no longer sufficient to depict the obligation to fulfil the liability; and accrual of interest to reflect any financing component of the liability. One way to apply a historical cost measurement basis to financial assets and financial liabilities is to measure them at amortised cost. For variable rate instruments measured at amortised cost, the discount rate is updated to reflect changes in the variable rate. Current value Current value measures provide monetary information about assets, liabilities and related income and expenses, using information updated to reflect conditions at the measurement date. Current value measurement bases include: Fair value Because fair value is not derived, even in part, from the price of the transaction
