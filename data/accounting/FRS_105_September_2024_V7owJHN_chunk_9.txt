produce economic benefits. It is only necessary that the right already exists. Control links an economic resource to a micro-entity. Assessing whether control exists helps to identify the economic resource for which the micro-entity accounts. A micro-entity controls an economic resource if it has the present ability to direct the use of the economic resource and obtain the economic benefits that may flow from it. A micro-entity has the present ability to direct the use of an economic resource if it has the right to deploy that economic resource in its activities, or to allow another party to deploy the economic resource in that other party’s activities. Definition of a liability For a liability to exist, three criteria must all be satisfied: the micro-entity has an obligation; the obligation is to transfer an economic resource; and the obligation is a present obligation that exists as a result of past events.

It is not necessary to know the identity of the party (or parties) to whom the obligation is owed. Many obligations are established by contract, legislation or similar means and are legally enforceable by the party (or parties) to whom they are owed. Obligations can also arise, however, from a micro-entity’s customary practices, published policies or specific statements if the micro-entity has no practical ability to act in a manner inconsistent with those practices, policies or statements. The obligation that arises in such situations is sometimes referred to as a constructive obligation. To satisfy the criterion in paragraph 2.14(b), the obligation must have the potential to require the micro-entity to transfer an economic resource to another party (or parties). For that potential to exist,
