A or J must be used. Example 2 A 20 year old apprentice terminates the apprenticeship and receives an irregular payment after leaving the employment. Category H cannot be used as the apprenticeship has ended. Whether category M, Z or A should be used depends on whether the ex-apprentice is still 20 or has turned 21. Two or more payments together If an employee gets 2 or more payments together after leaving, the earnings period is dependent on what those payments are. If all the payments are salary or wages (including one which may be a Ôweek-in-handÕ payment) work out National Insurance contributions on each payment separately using the usual earnings period. If some payments are salary and others are irregular sums, add the payments together and work out National Insurance contributions on the total using the usual earnings period for the payment of salary. If all payments are irregular sums, add them together and work out National Insurance contributions using a weekly earnings period.
