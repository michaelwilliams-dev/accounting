costs incurred in satisfying that performance obligation, the micro-entity shall recognise revenue only to the extent of the costs incurred. Contract costs Costs to obtain a contract A micro-entity shall recognise costs to obtain a contract with a customer as an expense when incurred, unless those costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer regardless of whether the contract is obtained. Costs of fulfilling a contract A micro-entity shall recognise costs incurred in fulfilling a contract with a customer as an expense when incurred, unless those costs: are in scope of another section of this FRS (eg Section 10 Inventories, Section 12 Property, Plant and Equipment, or Section 13 Intangible Assets other than Goodwill); or give rise to resources that the micro-entity will use to satisfy (or continue to satisfy) performance obligations in the future and the costs are expected to be recovered, in which case a micro-entity shall recognise those costs as an asset. After initial recognition, a micro-entity shall measure assets recognised in accordance with paragraph 18.48(b) at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Additional guidance Warranties A micro-entity might provide a warranty in connection with the sale of a product (whether a good or service). A micro-entity shall account for the warranty in accordance with Section 16 Provisions and Contingencies unless the customer can purchase the warranty separately (ie there is a choice of purchasing the product with or without a warranty). If the micro-entity provides the customer with the option to purchase the warranty separately, the warranty is a separate performance obligation (see Step 2). Non-cash consideration To determine the transaction price (see Step 3) for contracts in which a customer promises consideration in a form other than cash, a micro-entity shall measure the non-cash consideration (or promise of non-cash consideration) at fair value.
