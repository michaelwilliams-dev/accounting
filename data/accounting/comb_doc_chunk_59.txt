presented as if the new policy has always been applied. The requirements of retrospective application are set out in paragraph 10.12. Small entities will also need to provide the disclosures required by paragraph 10.14. Changes in eligibility If an entity has taken advantage of the exemption but subsequently ceases to be a small entity, as per paragraph 11.13B, it may determine the present value of the liability: on the basis of the facts and circumstances existing at that time; or at the date the financing arrangement was entered into.

An entity only makes an assessment of whether it is eligible for the small entities regime at the reporting date, therefore, at that date, the liability would be remeasured to present value with the associated adjustment to equity. The income statement effect will be recognised from the following reporting period. For example, if an entity was no longer eligible for the small entities regime for the year ending 31 December 2019, it would adjust the carrying value of the loan as at 31 December 2019.
