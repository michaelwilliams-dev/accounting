Menu Introduction to the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) This section gives a brief introduction to CIS. The scheme sets out the rules for how payments to subcontractors for construction work must be handled by contractors in the construction industry and certain other businesses. Under the scheme, all payments made from contractors to subcontractors must take account of the subcontractor’s tax status, as determined by HMRC. This may require the contractor to make a deduction, which they then pay to HMRC, from that part of the payment that does not represent the cost of materials incurred by the subcontractor. Types of work that are covered by the scheme The scheme covers all construction work carried out in the UK, including jobs such as: site preparation alterations dismantling construction repairs decorating demolition The UK includes UK territorial waters up to the 12 mile limit. The scheme does not apply to construction work carried on outside the UK. However, a business based outside the UK and carrying out construction work within the UK is within the scheme and must register accordingly. There is more information on the scope of the scheme in paragraphs 2.18 to 2.20 and in Appendix A. There is more information on businesses not resident in the UK at Section 5. Types of businesses that are covered by the scheme The scheme covers all types of businesses and other concerns that work in the construction industry, including: companies partnerships self-employed individuals These businesses can be: contractors subcontractors contractors and subcontractors Under the scheme, the terms ‘contractor’ and ‘subcontractor’ have special meanings that cover more than is generally referred to as ‘construction’.
