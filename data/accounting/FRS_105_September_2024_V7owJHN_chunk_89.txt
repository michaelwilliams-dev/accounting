– Identify the performance obligations in the contract (see paragraphs 18.12 to 18.19); Step 3 – Determine the transaction price (see paragraphs 18.20 to 18.25); Step 4 – Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (see paragraphs 18.26 to 18.33); and Step 5 – Recognise revenue when (or as) the micro-entity satisfies a performance obligation (see paragraphs 18.34 to 18.46). A micro-entity shall apply this section consistently to contracts with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances. This section specifies the accounting for an individual contract with a customer. A micro-entity may apply this section to a portfolio of similar contracts (or performance obligations) if the entity reasonably expects that the result of doing so would not differ materially from the result of applying this section to the individual contracts (or performance obligations) within that portfolio. Revenue recognition for simple transactions or transactions that are completed within one reporting period All contracts with customers are subject to the same revenue recognition model. However, application of that model may be simpler in the case of simpler contracts, or contracts that are completed within a single reporting period. In the case of such contracts: A micro-entity may be able to determine more easily the application of some steps in the revenue recognition model. For example: when a contract is complete and all the consideration promised by the customer has been received it is usually clear that the criteria in paragraph 18.7 are met; when only the micro-entity is involved in providing goods or services to a customer it is usually clear that the micro-entity is a principal (see paragraphs 18.15 to 18.19); when the consideration promised in a contract is an agreed fixed cash amount it is usually straightforward to apply Step 3 – Determine the transaction price; and
