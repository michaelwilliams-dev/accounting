Student Loan repayments and any CIS deductions that the company is due to pay by the amount of CIS deductions made from the company’s own income. This should be done monthly (or quarterly, as appropriate) and the calculation should be shown on the company’s Employer Payment Summary (EPS). If HMRC identify or suspect an inaccurate deduction has been claimed by a subcontractor against their employer liabilities, the subcontractor will be asked to amend the claim or provide evidence for the deduction. If the subcontractor does not amend or provide evidence within the set timeframe, HMRC will correct the claim and the subcontractor will be prevented from making further claims in the same tax year. This decision can be appealed — read section 4.22. If, for any month or quarter, the company’s own CIS deductions are greater than the PAYE, National Insurance contributions, Student Loan repayments and CIS liabilities payable, the company should set-oﬀ the excess against future payments in the same tax year. At the end of the tax year, once we’ve received the company’s final Full Payment Submission (FPS) and final EPS, any excess CIS deductions that cannot be set oﬀ may be refunded or set against Corporation Tax due. No repayments or set-oﬀs against other liabilities can be made in-year except where the company is in liquidation or administration. Companies may keep their own records for this purpose or they may use form Construction Industry Scheme: record of amounts set-oﬀ (CIS132).
