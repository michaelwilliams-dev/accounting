a previously recognised impairment loss if in a subsequent period the amount of an impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (eg an improvement in the debtorâ€™s credit rating). The micro-entity shall recognise the amount of the reversal in profit or loss immediately. Onerous contracts At each reporting date a micro-entity shall assess whether a derivative constitutes an onerous contract. A derivative is an onerous contract when the expected unavoidable payments exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the derivative. A derivative which does not mitigate a specific risk or risks of a micro-entity is an onerous contract when the expected payments exceed the expected cash receipts under the contract. The present obligation arising from an onerous contract shall be measured in accordance with Section 16. Example: Assessment of whether a derivative is onerous| A micro-entity takes out a loan with a variable rate of interest. In order to mitigate the risk of fluctuating interest payments, the micro-entity enters into an interest rate swap. Through the interest rate swap the micro-entity pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate of interest equal to the interest on the loan. Scenario 1: Interest rates are going down and as a result the payments made by the micro-entity under the interest rate swap are higher than the receipts. The interest rate swap is not an onerous contract because the micro-entity continues to benefit from the interest rate swap by effectively paying a fixed rate of interest on the loan. Scenario 2: The micro-entity repays the loan early, but the interest rate swap cannot be terminated. The micro-entity expects that the payments due under the interest rate swap exceed the receipts. The interest rate swap is an onerous
