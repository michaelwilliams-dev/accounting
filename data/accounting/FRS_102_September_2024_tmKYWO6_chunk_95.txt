permissible and financially feasible. 2A.11 An entity’s current use of a non-financial asset is presumed to be its highest and best use unless factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset. 2A.12 If the highest and best use of a non-financial asset is or would be achieved through its use in combination with other assets (and liabilities) as a group, the fair value measurement of the non-financial asset shall reflect that use, by assuming that a market participant already holds the complementary assets and the associated liabilities. Assumptions about the highest and best use shall be consistent for all the assets (and liabilities) within that group. Application to liabilities 2A.13 The fair value of a liability reflects the effect of non‑performance risk. Non‑performance risk is assumed to be the same before and after the transfer of the liability. 2A.14 The fair value of a financial liability that is due on demand is not less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date that the amount could be required to be paid. Valuation techniques 2A.15 The entity shall use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of inputs determined by reference to a market price in an active market. An entity shall use the following methodology to estimate fair value: The best evidence of fair value is an unadjusted quoted price for an identical or comparable asset or liability in an active market at the measurement date. When an unadjusted quoted price is not available, the price of a recent orderly transaction between market participants for an identical or comparable asset or liability provides evidence of fair value. However, this price may not be a
