swap are reset and fixed annually in advance on 31 December based on the expected IBOR rates applicable at that time. Note that in practice the loan and swap interest rates would be reset more frequently than assumed for the purpose of simplification in this example. The entity hedges the variability of the interest rate payments on the bank loan based on 3-month IBOR. It should be noted that because the entity receives interest based on 6-month IBOR under the interest rate swap, ineffectiveness will arise because the expected cash flows of the hedged item and the hedging instrument differ. The fair value of the interest rate swap may be affected by other factors that cause ineffectiveness, for example counterparty credit risk, but these have been disregarded in this example. There are no transaction costs. The entityâ€™s financial year ends on 31 December. This example assumes that the qualifying conditions for hedge accounting in paragraph 12.18 are met from 1 January 20X5. The table in paragraph 12A.5 summarises the impact of hedge accounting on the interest rate swap, profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The table below sets out the applicable IBOR rates, interest payments and swap settlements. The fair values of the interest rate swap and the hedged item shown in the table are shown for illustrative purposes only. Note that in practice, when forecasted variable interest rate payments are the hedged item, the fair value of a hypothetical swap, that would be expected to perfectly offset the hedged cash flows, is used as a proxy of the fair value of the hedged item. The hypothetical derivative in this scenario is a fixed to floating interest rate swap with terms that match those of the loan and a fixed rate of 4.3%, which for the purpose of this
