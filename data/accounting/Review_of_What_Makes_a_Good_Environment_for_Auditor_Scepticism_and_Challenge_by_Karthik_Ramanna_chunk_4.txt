certification exams. They are most effectively taught through the case-study method of education, where students are exposed to a series of challenging scenarios without any manifestly correct answers, and where they must debate and reason with each other, under the thoughtful guidance of a facilitator, on how they will decide on the matter. This Socratic- style education is the on-the-job learning in soft skills that (especially junior) auditors are crying out for. An urgent next step is to train the trainers (i.e., audit partners and engagement managers) in imparting this education amongst their mentees. It will involve getting otherwise garrulous audit leaders to themselves embody the practice of active listening as a way to inspire and mobilise their juniors into this mindset. Beyond critical thinking and judgement, another essential element of challenge that is underdeveloped in audit education is the art of disagreeing without being disagreeable. This is what the middle Stoics referred to as “dialectical sophistication” – the ability to manage emotion and impulse whilst serving a mission or doing one’s duty. It is the basis for effective challenge, particularly in the current environment where auditors must challenge those who seemingly make the decisions on whether they stay or go and how much they must be paid. A further impediment to challenge that is discussed later in this paper is the overworked status of auditors, a situation that can impede their mental and emotional bandwidth to push back against client unreasonableness. Here, all I will note is that the situation calls for (more or better) training in time-management skills amongst especially pre-partner ranks. Another element of needed training that may have emerged from the BritainThinks focus groups is acculturation of Millennial and now Gen Z workers to the state of discomfort that defines challenging a client. Younger workers may
