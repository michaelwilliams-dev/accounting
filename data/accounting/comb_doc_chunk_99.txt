carried at historical cost any other company law disclosures relating to revalued property will be required. 7 In this example, Entity C must be applying either IFRS or FRS 101 as FRS 105 does not permit revaluation of property, plant and equipment. Examples If the property is restated to the original cost of CU1,000 the following adjustment would be required: Dr|Revaluation Reserve|CU84,660|| Dr Cr|Accumulated depreciation Property, plant and equipment|CU14,3407| CU99,000| No adjustment is required on transition for Property B8. This represents three years depreciation (from 31 December 2014 to 1 January 2018) on the revalued amount being Â£15,000 in total (CU100,000 x 3 / 20 years remaining) less 33 years depreciation (from 31 Dec 1984 to 1 January 2018) on the historical cost being CU660 in total (CU1,000 x 33 / 50 years) which is not adjusted for. The exemption to permit revaluation as deemed cost is available at the level of individual items of property, plant and equipment. Entity C could choose to revalue Property B at the date of transition and use that new valuation as deemed cost. Similarly, as an alternative to using the 2014 valuation for Property A, Entity C could revalue it at the transition date (irrespective of whether Property B is revalued at transition date). Borrowing costs Entity E decided to construct a new building for its own use. Work on the construction commenced during 2017. Entity E capitalised tangible fixed assets on the basis of cost, in accordance with its previous financial reporting framework, but had not previously constructed any significant assets. As at 31 December 2017, Entity E had capitalised construction costs of CU25,000 and estimated that it still had approximately nine months of construction work ahead. Entity E had a accounting policy of not capitalising borrowing costs, but if it did
