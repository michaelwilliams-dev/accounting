to the user’s ability to understand the management of capital by the entity, its financial adaptability in changing circumstances, and the resources available to each group of policyholders. IG3.14 In relation to liabilities arising from long-term insurance business, the entity should include the following additional information: the process used to determine the assumptions that have the greatest effect on the measurement of liabilities including options and guarantees and, where practicable, quantified disclosure of those assumptions; those terms and conditions of options and guarantees relating to long-term insurance contracts that could in aggregate have a material effect on the amount, timing and uncertainty of the entity’s future cash flows; and information about exposures to interest rate risk or market risk under options and guarantees if the entity does not measure these at fair value or at an amount estimated using a market-consistent stochastic model. IG3.15 Although it is important to explain all movements in liabilities and capital during the period that are material to the group, this does not imply that the impact of each change in assumption needs to be shown separately. Where there is a common cause for the change of assumption the impacts can be grouped together. As an example, the impact of changes in investment return attributable to changing market circumstances does not need to be broken down between the various classes of investment. IG3.16 The description of the process would include the objective (whether a best-estimate or a given level of assurance is intended); the sources of data; whether assumptions are consistent with observable market data or other published information; how past experience, current conditions and future trends are taken into account; correlations between different assumptions; management’s policy for future bonuses; and the nature and extent of uncertainties affecting the assumptions. IG3.17 Options and guarantees are
