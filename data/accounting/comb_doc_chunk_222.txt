to its parent. The present value of the loan using a market rate of interest for a similar loan is CU9004. The difference of CU100 is a distribution to the parent. The parent would record the following accounting entries in its individual financial statements: Dr Cash CU1,000 Cr Loan repayable to subsidiary CU900 Cr Distribution received from subsidiary (profit or loss)5 CU100 The subsidiary would record the following accounting entries: Dr Loan receivable from parent CU900 Dr Distribution to parent (equity)6 CU100 Cr Cash CU1,000 Example 3: Fixed term interest-free loans between fellow subsidiaries In a situation where fellow subsidiaries enter into a loan which constitutes a financing transaction, it can generally be presumed that the loan was made on the direction of their parent. However, sometimes the facts and circumstances may indicate otherwise, for example when an interest-free loan is made in return for receiving goods or services at a discounted price. If an interest-free loan is made on the direction of the parent, the subsidiaries account for the transaction as if it had been conducted through the parent. The lending subsidiary accounts for the loan as if it had made a loan to its parent and the borrowing subsidiary accounts for the loan as if it had received a loan from its parent. The transaction is not required to be reflected in the parentâ€™s own financial statements because the parent is not directly involved. As noted in Example 2 above, a fixed term interest-free loan consists, in substance, of two separate components. In the case of an interest-free loan between fellow subsidiaries, the first component represents a loan made at a market-rate of interest and the second component is a distribution or capital contribution. The accounting is demonstrated in the following numerical example. 4 See Example 6 below
