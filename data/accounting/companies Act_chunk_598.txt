purported appointment is made in breach of section 485A, 485B or 485C (requirements applying to appointment of auditors by public interest entities), the Secretary of State may appoint another auditor or auditors in place of the auditor or auditors referred to in paragraph (a). The breach of section 485A, 485B or 485C does not invalidate any report made under Chapter 3 of this Part by the auditor or auditors on the company’s annual reports or accounts before the auditor or auditors are replaced under subsection (1) of this section. But where the breach in question is a breach of section 485C, sections 1248 and 1249 (Secretary of State’s power to require second audit) apply as if the auditor was not an appropriate person, or the auditors were not appropriate persons, for the period during which the audit was conducted. Within one week of becoming aware of the breach of section 485A, 485B or 485C, the company must give notice to the Secretary of State that the power under subsection (1) of this section has become exercisable. If the company fails to give the notice required by subsection (4), an offence is committed by— the company, and every officer of the company who is in default.
