reinforce quality-linked behaviours, some junior auditors and audit managers can feel this is dependent upon them asking for this feedback. Little or no time given to highlighting positive instances of scepticism and challenge behaviours, either in smaller team or wider service line meetings. A small number of associates also felt that there was a lack of consistency in terms of what behaviours are actually being recognised, with some partners seeming to mostly praise work ethic over scepticism and challenge. Furthermore, some auditors did not feel that formalised award processes at their firm were sufficiently visible. Whilst they were aware that these do exist (or did in the past), they did not feel that the firm itself is as consistent with this form of recognition as it should be. Amongst some junior auditors and audit managers there was a perception that these processes ‘start with a bang’ but quickly lose momentum, seemingly being forgotten about by the majority of partners after a short period of time. Some placed this in the wider context of proactive recognition generally slipping during Covid-19 and with remote working, but felt there were few signs of these returning thus far at some firms. Implications: How reward and recognition can drive desired auditor behaviours By moving beyond lock-step models of remuneration to reward scepticism and challenge, at all levels Ensuring that financial remuneration is directly and explicitly linked to quality, and ideally within this the specific behaviours of scepticism and challenge, for all levels, not just partners, is critical to ensuring that scepticism and challenge behaviours that drive high quality audits are being universally rewarded. Auditors are looking to be properly compensated for the work they put in, and whilst progression can be harmed by poor quality scores, little appears to be on offer for those that
