help bring to life these specific behaviours and demonstrate what good looks like. However, some still felt there is room for improvement. For auditors at manager level and above, longstanding resourcing issues in the audit industry can make the consistent and effective delivery of coaching more challenging as they struggle to find the time alongside heavy workloads. And for many auditors across all grades, Covid-19 has exacerbated these challenges by depleting the opportunity for ad hoc and informal interactions where hybrid working has not been properly embedded. Similarly, many felt that increased use of virtual, lengthy, lecture-style formal training sessions necessitated by the pandemic had led to poor engagement with more formal learning. What’s working well Involving colleagues at all levels in informal training Across all firms, many auditors across levels saw coaching as the best method for teaching audit staff how to effectively exercise scepticism and challenge. This is largely because auditors feel these behaviours are difficult to learn through purely theory-based training. Real-world experience was highlighted as important for understanding the breadth of instances of where scepticism should be applied, providing tangible examples of doing so, and in helping to build confidence in auditors’ ability to challenge management by practising this behaviour. Some junior auditors mentioned that one-to-one meetings with senior colleagues to work through issues in real time is most effective for helping them learn how to exercise scepticism and challenge. This is because they are provided with live feedback to learn from in future and it gives them an opportunity to be shown where and how best to exercise scepticism as well as what issues might need escalating into a challenge. As noted in previous chapters of this report, many junior and senior auditors pointed out that coaching scepticism and challenge works best when junior colleagues
