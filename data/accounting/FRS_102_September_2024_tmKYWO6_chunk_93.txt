Classification of equity To provide useful information, it may be necessary to classify components of equity separately if some of those components are subject to particular legal, regulatory or other requirements. Aggregation Aggregation is the adding together of assets, liabilities, equity, income or expenses that have shared characteristics and are included in the same classification.
