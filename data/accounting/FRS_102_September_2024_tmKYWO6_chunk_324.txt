Performance obligations do not include activities that an entity must undertake to fulfil a contract unless those activities transfer a good or service to the customer. For example, set-up activities and administrative tasks which do not transfer a good or service to the customer would be disregarded for the purposes of identifying performance obligations in a contract.

The criterion in paragraph 23.21(a) is satisfied for goods or services that are regularly sold separately. For the purposes of applying the criterion in paragraph 23.21(a), readily available resources are: goods or services sold separately (by the entity or another entity); or goods or services that the customer has already obtained from the entity (including goods or services transferred to the customer under the contract) or from other transactions or events. The purpose of the criterion in paragraph 23.21(b) is to determine whether the nature of the entity’s promise, within the context of the contract, is to transfer the good or service individually, rather than to transfer a combined item or items to which the good or service is an input.
