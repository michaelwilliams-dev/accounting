Release the grant to the P&L (£200,000 / 50 years) Dr Deferred grants £4,000 Cr P&L (grant income) £4,000 FRS 102 Performance model Under FRS 102, where the entity elects to apply the performance model, the whole grant is recognised in profit or loss immediately. This is because there are no provisions requiring deferral of the grant received, as the only condition was that the factory must be constructed and this condition has been fulfilled. Recognition of the factory (fixed asset) Dr Fixed assets £600,000 Cr Cash £600,000 Initial recognition of the grant Dr Cash £200,000 Cr Grant income (P&L) £200,000 Recognition of depreciation charge on the factory (£600,000 / 50 years) Dr Depreciation (P&L) £12,000 Cr Fixed assets £12,000 Note: If the fact pattern changed, this example may show a less stark difference between SSAP 4 and the performance model in accordance with FRS 102. For instance, if the company had an obligation to use the factory (and hence provide local employment) for a certain period following its construction, the grant would be recognised later. The mechanism for recognising the grant during the specified period would depend on the detailed terms and conditions, and would not necessarily be based on the expected useful life of the building. Accrual model Under FRS 102, where the entity elects to apply the accrual model, the accounting would be the same as SSAP 4. It should be noted that paragraph 2.52 of FRS 102 does not permit an entity to offset assets and liabilities, or income and expenses, unless required or permitted by the FRS, and that paragraph 24.5G of FRS 102 explicitly prohibits the deduction of a government grant relating to an asset from the carrying amount of the fixed asset.
