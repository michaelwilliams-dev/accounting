In other jurisdictions, income taxes may be refundable or payable if part or all of the profit or retained earnings is paid out as a dividend to shareholders of the entity. In both of those circumstances, an entity shall measure current and deferred taxes at the tax rate applicable to undistributed profits until the entity recognises a liability to pay a dividend. When the entity recognises a liability to pay a dividend, it shall recognise the resulting current or deferred tax liability (asset), and the related tax expense (income). A As an exception, when: an entity is wholly-owned by one or more charitable55 entities; it is probable that a gift aid payment will be made to a member of the same charitable group, or a charitable venturer, within nine months of the reporting date; and that payment will qualify to be set against profits for tax purposes, the income tax effects of that gift aid payment shall be recognised at the reporting date. The income tax effects shall be measured consistently with the tax treatment planned to be used in the entityâ€™s income tax filings. A deferred tax liability shall not be recognised in relation to such a gift aid payment. Deferred tax relating to a non-depreciable asset that is measured using the revaluation model in Section 17 Property, Plant and Equipment shall be measured using the tax rates and allowances that apply to the sale of the asset. Deferred tax relating to investment property that is measured at fair value in accordance with Section 16 Investment Property shall be measured using the tax rates and allowances that apply to the sale of the asset, except for investment property that has a limited useful life and is held within a business
