Consider if the business is a property investor or property developer A property investment business acquires and disposes of buildings for capital gain or uses the buildings for rental. A property investment business can change from ‘property investor’ to ‘property developer’ where the property investment business undertakes multiple or substantial contracts relating to construction operations for the purposes of development of one or more properties. If its activities include the construction of an entirely new property or a redevelopment of a property, leading to change in its nature of use, then that part of its activities will amount to property development, and it will be immediately within the scope of CIS as a mainstream contractor.
