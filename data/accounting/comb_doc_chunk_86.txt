and equipment After initial recognition, property, plant and equipment shall be measured using the cost model or the revaluation model. When the revaluation model is selected it shall be applied to all items of property, plant and equipment in the same class of asset. When the revaluation model is selected an item of property, plant and equipment whose fair value can be measured reliably shall be carried at a revalued amount, being its fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Revaluations shall be made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from the fair value at the reporting date. Usually any revaluation gains are recognised in other comprehensive income (unless they reverse a previous decrease that was recognised in profit or loss) and accumulated in a separate component of equity, the revaluation reserve. Recognising changes in fair value in other comprehensive income is an application of the alternative accounting rules of Schedule 1 to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/410) (the Regulations), specifically paragraph 35. Example Entity A has an office building and decides that it will choose to use the revaluation model for the subsequent measurement of its buildings. Its fair value at 31 December 2017 was CU200,000 and its fair value at 31 December 2018 was CU215,000. The change in fair value is recognised as follows: Dr Land and buildings CU15,000 Cr Revaluation reserve (recognised in OCI) CU15,000 Entity A will also need to account for any deferred tax implications arising from the change in fair value. Subsequently the depreciation charge for each period is based on the relevant revalued amount and Entity A may transfer an amount from the revaluation reserve to retained earnings to
