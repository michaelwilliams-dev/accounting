we have provided a non-exhaustive list of considerations that auditors may wish to take account of before making use of ADA in the evidence collection stage of the audit. The focus of this guidance is on using ADA in order to respond to risks, as part of substantive testing and evidence collection, rather than on assessing the risk of material misstatement at the planning stage of an audit, for example in journals testing where the use of analytics is now relatively commonplace, and approaches are more established. The example below is focused on auditorsâ€™ use of ADA as substantive procedures in order to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence2, though the general principles and approach are may be 1 Terms in bold are defined in full in the glossary 2 ISA (UK) 315 (Revised July 2020) Identifying and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement, Paragraph A14/A31 informative when an auditor is making use of analytical tools to assess risk, or at the completion stage of an audit3 to assist when forming an overall conclusion. Finally, although some of the principles may be applicable, this is not intended as a guide to making use of ADA in the testing of controls. The guidance included below is non-authoritative and does not represent the only possible way to address the potential volume of exceptions generated when using ADA. Users are encouraged to apply the general principles, diagrams, and specific example as a starting point, adapted and modified for the specific tools they are making use of in an audit. Tools which are substantially more complex than those described here are likely to require additional consideration and more detailed analysis. Key Principles A common problem for auditors making use of ADA is the volume of outliers which may be generated when applying such tools to
