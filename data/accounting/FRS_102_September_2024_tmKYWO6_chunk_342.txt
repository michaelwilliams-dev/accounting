If an entity can objectively determine (ie determine based on information available to the entity) that control of a good or service has been transferred to the customer in accordance with the agreed-upon specifications in the contract, then customer acceptance is a formality that would not affect the entity’s determination of when the customer has obtained control of the good or service. However, if an entity cannot objectively determine that the good or service provided to the customer is in accordance with the agreed-upon specifications in the contract, then the entity would not be able to conclude that the customer has obtained control until the entity receives the customer’s acceptance. Repurchase agreements A repurchase agreement is a contract in which an entity sells an asset and also promises or has the option (either in the same contract or in another contract) to repurchase the asset. The repurchased asset may be the asset that was originally sold to the customer, an asset that is substantially the same as that asset, or another asset of which the asset that was originally sold is a component. When evaluating whether a customer obtains control of an asset, an entity shall consider any repurchase agreements. In applying paragraphs 23.92 to 23.97: when comparing the repurchase price with the selling price, an entity shall consider the time value of money; and if an option lapses unexercised, the entity shall derecognise the liability and recognise revenue. A forward or a call option If an entity has an obligation or a right to repurchase an asset (a forward or a call option), a customer does not obtain control of the asset and the entity shall not recognise revenue from a sale of a good or service. Consequently, the entity shall account for the contract
