equipped with the technical knowledge and skills to enable them to perform UK audit procedures. A gap analysis between the ODC and UK training curriculums should be performed to identify additional training required to ensure consistency in skills, technical knowledge and UK specific requirements. Graduate hires in the UK should be provided with on-the-job training on the routine and non- judgemental tasks usually allocated to ODCs. This would develop onshore junior auditors’ skills and knowledge in understanding and reviewing the work being completed by ODCs, and improve their approach to collaboration with the staff at the ODCs. Staff in ODCs should have appropriate support and be provided with on-the-job coaching, including receiving feedback from senior staff. For example, a two-way feedback mechanism could be put in place between the onshore and offshore teams, allowing both teams to provide feedback to identify areas of improvement for the future. Regular assessment and review of alignment between resourcing plans in the UK and at the ODCs. The resourcing growth plans for ODCs should be aligned with the UK’s plans to ensure there are sufficient qualified and skilled resources onshore to supervise and review the work undertaken by the ODCs, as the statutory responsibility for quality of audits rests with the UK firm. Appropriate controls should be in place to manage potential risks arising from competing resourcing demands at the ODCs, particularly in cases where the UK does not have dedicated staff allocated at the ODCs. Effective use of integrated technology and tools to facilitate collaboration between ODCs and onshore audit teams in the UK. A single workflow tool should be used to manage centralised services assigned from the onshore team to ODCs. This would allow interaction between offshore and onshore teams to be maintained in the same place: from request initiation, progress tracking,
