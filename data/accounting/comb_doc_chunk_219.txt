In that regard it is particularly important to establish the reasons a lender decided to make a loan at a non-market rate of interest. For example a lender may make the loan because of an ownership interest in the borrower.

Where a loan is made at a non-market rate of interest and the lender and the borrower are related parties because one owns the other or the lender and borrower are owned by the same entity or person, the difference arising on initial recognition of the loan would generally be accounted for as a distribution or capital contribution. FRS 102 sets out accounting requirements for distributions. For the entity making a distribution it represents a decrease of economic benefits that results in a decrease in equity. A distribution is not an expense and is therefore recorded as a reduction of equity (paragraphs 2.23(b) and 22.17 of FRS 102). It should be noted that in some cases a distribution may be recorded in the financial statements in accordance with FRS 102, although it may not be a distribution as a matter of law and vice versa. An entity that is subject to company law should consider whether the distribution recorded in the financial statements for reporting purposes is also a distribution as a matter of the law and if so, should assess whether it has sufficient distributable profits to make the distribution. The entity receiving a distribution records it as an income,
