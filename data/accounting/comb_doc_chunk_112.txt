Therefore in most situations short term receivables and payables are measured at their invoiced amount until they are settled or otherwise extinguished. Trade receivables are subject to impairment and must not be stated at a value higher than their recoverable amount. More information on the accounting for impairment of trade receivables can be found in Staff Education Note 3 Impairment of trade debtors. It is not expected that accounting differences will arise in respect of current trade receivables and trade payables when transitioning to FRS 102. Loans bearing a market rate of interest Paragraph 11.13 of FRS 102 requires that all financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recorded at the transaction price (unless it is a financing transaction as described in paragraph 11.13 of FRS 102, see Staff Education Note 16 for more detail). Loans bearing a market rate of interest will therefore be recognised at the initial value exchanged (ie the amount of the cash lent or received) including transaction costs. Loans that meet the conditions of a basic debt instrument set out in paragraphs 11.8(b) and 11.9 of FRS 102 are measured at amortised cost after initial recognition. Provided no transaction costs have been incurred or premiums/discounts have been paid/received, for loans bearing a market rate of interest, the effective interest rate is equal to the market rate of interest at the date of initial recognition. It is not expected that accounting differences will arise in respect of loans bearing a market rate of interest when transitioning to FRS 102. Financing transactions The term financing transaction is used in FRS 102 to specifically refer to transactions with deferred payments or repayments, for which there is no explicit interest rate or the interest charged is not at a market rate. Examples of such transactions include: the sale of
