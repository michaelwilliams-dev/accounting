amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. The requirements for amortisation are set out in paragraphs 13.9 to 13.14. Amortisation over useful life Intangible assets shall be considered to have a finite useful life. The useful life of an intangible asset that arises from contractual or other legal rights shall not exceed the period of the contractual or other legal rights, but may be shorter depending on the period over which the micro-entity expects to use the asset. If the contractual or other legal rights are conveyed for a limited term that can be renewed, the useful life of the intangible asset shall include the renewal period(s) only if there is evidence to support renewal by the micro-entity without significant cost. If, in exceptional cases, a micro-entity is unable to make a reliable estimate of the useful life of an intangible asset, the life shall not exceed ten years. Amortisation period and amortisation method A micro-entity shall allocate the depreciable amount of an intangible asset on a systematic basis over its useful life. The amortisation charge for each period shall be recognised in profit or loss, unless another section of this FRS requires the cost to be recognised as part of the cost of an asset. For example, the amortisation of an intangible asset may be included in the costs of inventories or property, plant and equipment. Amortisation begins when the intangible asset is available for use, ie when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be usable in the manner intended by management. Amortisation ceases when the asset is derecognised. The micro-entity shall choose an amortisation method that reflects the pattern in which it expects to consume the assetâ€™s future economic benefits. If the micro-entity cannot determine that pattern reliably, it shall use the straight-line method.
