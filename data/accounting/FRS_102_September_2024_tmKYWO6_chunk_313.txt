on liquidation is subject to a maximum amount (a ceiling). For example, if on liquidation the holders of the instrument receive a pro rata share of the net assets, but this amount is limited to a ceiling and the excess net assets are distributed to a charity organisation or the government, the instrument is not classified as equity. A puttable instrument is classified as equity if, when the put option is exercised, the holder receives a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity determined by: dividing the entity’s net assets on liquidation into units of equal amounts; and multiplying that amount by the number of the units held by the financial instrument holder. However, if the holder is entitled to an amount measured on some other basis the instrument is classified as a liability. An instrument is classified as a liability if it obliges the entity to make payments to the holder before liquidation, such as a mandatory dividend. A puttable instrument that is classified as equity in a subsidiary’s financial statements is classified as a liability in the consolidated financial statements. A preference share that provides for mandatory redemption by the issuer for a fixed or determinable amount at a fixed or determinable future date, or gives the holder the right to require the issuer to redeem the instrument at or after a particular date for a fixed or determinable amount, is a financial liability. Members’ shares in co-operative entities and similar instruments are equity if: the entity has an unconditional right to refuse redemption of the members’ shares; or redemption is unconditionally prohibited by local law, regulation or the entity’s governing charter.
