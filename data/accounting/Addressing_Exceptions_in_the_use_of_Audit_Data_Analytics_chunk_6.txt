A general approach to addressing outliers Where the auditor determines that sample testing is appropriate, but the population is not homogenous, the auditor considers if there is scope to stratify the population of exceptions into homogenous sub-populations before beginning sampling and substantive testing5. Auditors should also take care that when sampling based on sub-populations, the untested population in a single financial statement line item does not exceed materiality. When considering stratifying the population of exceptions into homogenous sub-populations, auditors may wish to consider the following characteristics: Monetary value6 – auditors may wish to stratify by the monetary value of the exceptions, allowing greater focus on larger value items which may be more likely to lead to a material misstatement. Qualitative characteristics6 – In addition to quantitive measures by which to stratify the population of exceptions, auditors may wish to consider if any particular qualitative characteristic may be used to stratify a population. For example, on examination of the population of exceptions, the auditor may discover that a large number occurred on a certain date, and in this instance stratifying by date may allow for more meaningful analysis. ISA (UK) 530 Audit Sampling, Appendix 1, Ref: Paragraph A8 ISA (UK) 530 Audit Sampling, Appendix 1, Para 2 Audit Data Analytics Refinement Process When refining the parameters of a tool after its initial application, the following are not generally appropriate reasons for adjusting a population expectation: Adjusting parameters to artificially reduce the volume of work required, therefore not obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence. Where an auditor does not have enough time to properly address the outliers generated, they should revise the audit plan in order to ensure they have the time and resources necessary to perform the engagement.7 Adjusting parameters to generate the same number of outliers as in the prior period.
