with long-term insurance business 25 Overview This Implementation Guidance accompanies, but is not part of, FRS 103 Insurance Contracts. Accordingly, it does not carry the authority of an accounting standard and shall not be regarded as mandatory. It provides guidance on applying: the requirements of FRS 103; the requirements or principles of FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland by entities with general insurance business or long-term insurance business; and the requirements of Schedule 3 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/410). A number of the sections of FRS 102 exclude insurance contracts from their scope. However, an insurer could consider the applicability of the requirements and guidance in FRS 102 (or another FRS) dealing with similar or related issues. Therefore, where relevant, this Implementation Guidance includes guidance on the application of the principles of certain sections of FRS 102 to insurance contracts, even though insurance contracts may not be within the scope of those sections. This is consistent with selecting accounting policies in accordance with the principles of FRS 102 and FRS 103. This Implementation Guidance has been developed from material that was previously included in either FRS 27 Life Assurance (prior to it being withdrawn by FRS 103) or the Association of British Insurersâ€™ Statement of Recommended Practice on Accounting for Insurance Business (the ABI SORP) (published in December 2005 and amended in December 2006 prior to it being withdrawn following the issue of FRS 103). Paragraphs that have been sourced from the ABI SORP, and to a lesser extent those from FRS 27, have been revised where they needed updating, for example to reflect new legislative requirements or for consistency with FRS 102. Each section of the Implementation Guidance specifies the requirements
