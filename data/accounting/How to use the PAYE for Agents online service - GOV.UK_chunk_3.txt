You’ll still operate PAYE in the same way but you must send your payroll information to us using a Full Payment Submission (https://www.gov.uk/running-payroll/reporting-to- hmrc). You should do this on, or before the day your clients pay their employees. Your payroll software will create the new reports you need and send the payroll information online. These will include details of: the amount paid to employees deductions such as Income Tax and National Insurance contributions starter and leaver dates (if applicable) How to submit PAYE details in real time Under real time information, you’ll still submit reports online but they’ll be sent directly to us using your PAYE payroll software (https://www.gov.uk/payroll-software) or HMRC Basic PAYE Tools (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-for- employers-on-using-basic-paye-tools-bpt). When your payroll software sends your reports, you’ll need your Government Gateway user ID and password associated with PAYE for agents to access them.
