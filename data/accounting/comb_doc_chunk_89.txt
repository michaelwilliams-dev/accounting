entities are required to do full retrospective restatement, however, Section 35 includes three mandatory exceptions to this rule and some 20 optional transitional exemptions. Full retrospective restatement means that all assets and liabilities at the date of transition (see below) are recognised (or derecognised), classified (or reclassified) and measured in accordance with FRS 102. When is the date of transition? One of the key terms used in Section 35 is the ‘date of transition’. The date of transition is the beginning of the earliest period for which an entity presents full comparative information. To illustrate this, for simplicity, this factsheet assumes the following fact pattern: An entity wishes to present financial statements for the first time under FRS 102 for the year ended 31 December 2019 with one year of full comparative information. Section 35 acknowledges that some entities may choose to present more than one period of comparative information, however we expect the vast majority of entities to present just one comparative period. Based on the illustrative fact pattern above, the date of transition would be the beginning of the comparative period (ie 1 January 2018). It is not 1 January 2019 ie not the beginning of the current reporting period. Diagram 1 summarises the key dates for the illustrative fact pattern, and the associated disclosures required.
