Power to re-issue redeemed debentures Where a company has redeemed debentures previously issued, then unless— provision to the contrary (express or implied) is contained in the company's articles or in any contract made by the company, or the company has, by passing a resolution to that effect or by some other act, manifested its intention that the debentures shall be cancelled, the company may re-issue the debentures, either by re-issuing the same debentures or by issuing new debentures in their place. This subsection is deemed always to have had effect.
