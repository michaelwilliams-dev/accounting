option not previously included in its determination of the lease term). Leases for which the underlying asset is of low value The assessment of the value of an underlying asset for the purposes of applying paragraph 20.5(b) is performed on an absolute basis: leases of low-value assets qualify for this accounting treatment regardless of whether those leases are material to the lessee. The value of lease payments has no bearing on the assessment of whether an underlying asset is of low value. An underlying asset can be of low value for the purposes of paragraph 20.5(b) only if: the lessee can benefit from use of the underlying asset on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the lessee; and the underlying asset is not highly dependent on, or highly interrelated with, other assets. Examples of underlying assets that would not be of low value include: cars, vans, buses, coaches, trams, trucks and lorries; cranes, excavators, loaders and bulldozers; telehandlers and forklifts; tractors, harvesters and related attachments; boats and ships; railway rolling stock; aircraft and aero engines; land and buildings; and production line equipment. If a lessee subleases an asset, or expects to sublease an asset, the head lease does not qualify as a lease of a low-value asset. Portfolio application This section specifies the accounting for an individual lease. However, as a practical expedient, an entity may apply this section to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics (eg a similar lease term for a similar class of underlying asset in a similar economic environment). If accounting for a portfolio, an entity shall use estimates and assumptions that reflect the size and composition of the portfolio. Combination of contracts In applying this section, an entity shall combine two or more contracts entered into at or
