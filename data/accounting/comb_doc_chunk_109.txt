common key areas for consideration when transitioning to FRS 102, but is not in any way meant to be exhaustive and should therefore not be used as a substitute for a thorough analysis. Amortised cost measurement requirements in FRS 102 Paragraphs 11.15 to 11.20 of FRS 102 provide guidance on how to calculate amortised cost using the effective interest method. Paragraphs 11.15 and 11.16 are reproduced below: The amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability at each reporting date is the net of the following amounts: the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition; minus any repayments of the principal; plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between the amount at initial recognition and the maturity amount; minus, in the case of a financial asset, any reduction (directly or through the use of an allowance account) for impairment or uncollectability. Financial assets and financial liabilities that have no stated interest rate (and do not constitute a financing transaction) and are classified as payable or receivable within one year are initially measured at an undiscounted amount in accordance with paragraph 11.14(a). Therefore, (c) above does not apply to them. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability (or a group of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. The effective interest rate is determined on the basis of the carrying amount
