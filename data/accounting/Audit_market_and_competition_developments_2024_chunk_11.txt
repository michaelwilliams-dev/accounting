an audit firm. In the past year, we have heard growing concerns about significant increases in audit fees, which may be driven by various factors. For example, significant changes to IFRS accounting standards may have created additional work for auditors in the last year. Audit firms have reported growing cost pressures, including from wage inflation, and greater investment in technology. We have been exploring the extent of increases in audit fees, and what is driving these increases, and we will continue to monitor this closely. Not aiming to create a ‘Big Five’ Our broad focus on the whole market means the primary aim of our competition policy is not about growing another firm so it can rival the Big Four. Growing a firm to rival the Big Four would be very difficult to do. Forming an audit firm with a size, by PIE audit fee income, the same as the smallest of the Big Four (EY) is the equivalent of combining the next eight largest audit firms. It will take time to realise changes in the audit market Our evolving approach to competition continues to recognise that it will take time to realise any significant changes in the audit market, especially at the top end of the market. The existing issues are deep-seated and the market structure is heavily entrenched. It will take time – perhaps some considerable time – to realise a well-functioning audit market. Large audit firms operate internationally and their focus will vary in line with wider developments. A cross-system approach is required While we want to see a well-functioning audit market, it is not something we can deliver alone. A cross-system approach is required to ensure greater choice of audit firms for all companies, opportunities for auditors entering the workplace, and resilience for the whole market.
