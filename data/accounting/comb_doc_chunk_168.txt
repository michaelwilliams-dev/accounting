sale in its shops, which may need cleaning, repairing etc before being ready for sale. Some of the donated goods will not be suitable for sale, and the charity will then need to dispose of these goods, although textiles can be sold as rags, there may be costs involved in the disposal. Typically the donated goods have low individual second-hand values. Overall, over the course of a year, the cash proceeds from the sale of donated goods are a material source of income to the charity. There are no performance-related conditions attached to the donated goods, and therefore, in principle, the resources should be recognised as income when the goods are received. However, in order to recognise the income, the charity must be able to measure their value reliably, and have assessed the benefits of doing so as outweighing any costs involved. The charity believes that, because it does not receive donations of high value items and it is difficult to reliably estimate the fair value less costs to sell of individual donations, the costs of determining the value of resources received at the time of receipt, outweighs the benefits of providing users with more timely information on receipt of donated goods. Instead, the charity recognises the donated resources as income when cash has been raised from the subsequent sale of the donated goods. The charity discloses its accounting policy for donated goods. The charity should disclose any additional information that is relevant to understanding the extent of support received by the charity through donations.
