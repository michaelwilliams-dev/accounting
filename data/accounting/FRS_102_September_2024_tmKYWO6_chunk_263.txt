The acquirer shall measure the lease liability at the present value of the remaining lease payments as if the acquired lease were a new lease at the acquisition date. The acquirer shall measure the right-of-use asset at the same amount as the lease liability, adjusted to reflect favourable or unfavourable terms of the lease when compared with market terms. [Deleted] [Moved to paragraph 19.24A and amended] Recognising and measuring goodwill The acquirer shall, at the acquisition date: recognise goodwill acquired in a business combination as an asset; and initially measure that goodwill at its cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirer’s interest in the net amount of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised and measured in accordance with paragraphs 19.15 to 19.15C. After initial recognition, the acquirer shall measure goodwill acquired in a business combination at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses: An entity shall follow the principles in paragraphs 18.19 to 18.24 for amortisation of goodwill. Goodwill shall be considered to have a finite useful life, and shall be amortised on a systematic basis over its life. If, in exceptional cases, an entity is unable to make a reliable estimate of the useful life of goodwill, the life shall not exceed 10 years. An entity shall follow Section 27 Impairment of Assets for recognising and measuring the impairment of goodwill. Excess over cost of acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities If the acquirer’s interest in the net amount of the identifiable assets, liabilities and provisions for contingent liabilities recognised in accordance with paragraph 19.14 exceeds the cost of the business combination (also referred to as ‘negative goodwill’), the acquirer shall: Reassess the identification and measurement of the acquiree’s assets,
