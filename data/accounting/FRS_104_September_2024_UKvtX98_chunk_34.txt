annual level of sales has been achieved, if that required level of sales is expected to be achieved and the entity, therefore, has no realistic alternative but to make the future lease payment. Intangible assets A2.10 An entity will apply the definition and recognition criteria for an intangible asset in the same way in an interim period as in an annual period. Costs incurred before the recognition criteria for an intangible asset are met are recognised as an expense. Costs incurred after the specific point in time at which the criteria are met are recognised as part of the cost of an intangible asset. ‘Deferring’ costs as assets in an interim statement of financial position in the hope that the recognition criteria will be met later in the financial year is not justified. Pensions A2.11 The cost of a defined benefit plan for an interim period is calculated on a year-to-date basis. For the measurement of the defined benefit obligation at an interim reporting date refer to paragraph A2.42. Vacations, holidays, and other short-term compensated absences A2.12 Accumulating paid absences are those that are carried forward and can be used in future periods if the current period’s entitlement is not used in full. Section 28 of FRS 102 requires that an entity measure the expected cost of an obligation for accumulating paid absences at the amount the entity expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end of the reporting period. That principle is also applied at the end of interim financial reporting periods. Conversely, an entity recognises no expense or liability for non-accumulating paid absences at the end of an interim reporting period, just as it recognises none at the end of an annual reporting period.
