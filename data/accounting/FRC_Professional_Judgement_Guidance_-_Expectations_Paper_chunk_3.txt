(UK) 220) represents a significant opportunity to ensure that any professional judgement framework that is being applied helps address risks to audit quality within the firm. We would encourage those firms who do not yet have their own professional judgement framework to consider the merits of developing one, or applying the FRC’s. We further note that it is not simply the existence of a framework which is important, but how effectively it is utilised in the specific circumstances of a firm, or of an engagement. Applications of the Framework One further issue which has been considered by the FRC’s working group is how a Professional Judgement Framework should be applied in practice. This reflects divergent practice with some firms focussing on central methodology and/or training applications, and others focussing instead on more complex and subjective professional judgements made at the engagement level. The FRC believes that it is a matter for audit firms to decide which approach will be more effective in their individual circumstances. It is that assessment of how a framework can drive better and more consistent professional judgements that is critical, and how it can (or could) help manage risks to quality management. Audit firms will therefore need to understand what additional opportunities there are to ensure that a professional judgement framework is understood and socialised within the firm, and that appropriate expectations are set for how it can be used.
