edition of FRS 102 should have a limited impact in practice. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination B18.2 In the Triennial Review 2017, stakeholders provided feedback on the practical issues arising from applying paragraph 18.8 of FRS 102 in recognising and measuring intangible assets acquired in a business combination; in particular, the meaning and purpose of the phrase ‘immeasurable variables’. Further difficulties arose from the use of language that was similar to IFRS 3 Business Combinations, which notes that intangible assets acquired in a business combination can always be measured reliably. B18.3 Various options for improving FRS 102 were considered, including: allowing an undue cost or effort exemption as per the revised IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard; moving towards an IFRS 3 approach whereby all intangible assets are recognised separately from goodwill; or reverting back to an approach similar to FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets whereby some but not all intangibles are recognised separately. B18.4 Research indicated that some investors saw a distinction between those intangible assets that are ‘wasting’ (ie those that are separable from the entity, have finite useful lives and lead to identifiable future revenue streams) and those that are ‘organically replaced’ (ie those that are unlikely to be separable, to have reliably determined useful lives or to be a source of future economic benefits that could be distinguished from the business as a whole). Some investors argued that those intangibles that are ‘wasting’ assets should be recognised separately from goodwill, whereas those that are ‘organically replaced’ should be subsumed into goodwill. B18.5 It was also noted that FRS 102 requires goodwill to be amortised over its useful life, which is consistent with the accounting treatment of intangible assets. Therefore, the impetus to separate intangible assets from goodwill is less than it may be under
