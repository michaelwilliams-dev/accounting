and suggestions for practical application. Embedding of cultural change among workers, but also other stakeholders, has been discussed in various parts of this report. In essence, consultation – rather than dictation, when it comes to culture-related initiatives, including values, purpose and behaviours, as well as constant and consistent communication, were said to lead to stronger embedding of culture. If the workforce feel connected to organisational values and purpose, this will foster deeper connections, which in turn should lead to greater engagement and productivity on their part. This approach can also be extended to other stakeholder groups and other issues. 11b Assurance Best practice suggests that boards should seek periodic assurance that underlying policies and practices, as well as promoted behaviours, are in line with corporate purpose, values and strategy. Yet, too often, companies don’t report on it, despite widespread practice. The poll of 40 companies, conducted by the IIA among members, revealed that 82% of companies undertake some form of culture audit. Cultural matters are increasingly embedded into the audit process, either by including them into the standard audit or by making them standalone, with most of those polled either opting for the first option (incorporation) or combination of the two (hybrid). Interestingly, only 5% of organisations opted for the standalone culture audit. For those internal audit functions that don’t consider their organisation’s corporate culture, their approach could be explain by the lack of a clear mandate from the top. When asked whether company boards/audit committees proactively commission internal auditors to audit or provide reports on corporate culture, a majority (68%) answered ‘no’, with a few (8%) not being sure. Several companies report that the mandate can typically be on an ad-hoc basis and is triggered either by unusual activity within a single business unit/department or by an M&A transaction
