across all firms. In particular, there was a sense that where auditors on engagements are less physically visible and accessible to each other, more casual check-ins, questions and prompts are not happening as organically as when in the office. This was seen to reduce opportunities for senior colleagues to encourage scepticism and challenge and for junior colleagues to challenge internally as part of more informal conversations. It should be noted that this barrier was also felt to exist when working in offices where auditors can be physically separated from one another (e.g. partners sitting in isolated offices). Senior auditors were concerned that unless encouraged to do so virtually, junior auditors are less likely to reach out to ask questions or double-check things when working remotely, as it feels more formal and time-consuming compared to informal office- based interactions – and as a result, lack confidence and comfort around challenging more broadly (e.g. to audited entities). “The senior manager came in right at the end [of the audit], clarified the review...apart from that we didn’t see them very much.” (Associate / Senior associate) “In the office you can ask people faster.” (Senior manager / Director) Senior auditors also believed that a pre-existing tendency among junior auditors to prefer emailing over making phone calls had been exacerbated by the pandemic, and can hinder effective challenge, for example because emails can be unclear or misconstrued. In particular, senior auditors felt they had seen more examples of ineffective challenge of audited entities via email (compared to other channels), where management had felt the tone was overly confrontational, and so responded in a defensive or unhelpful way to the engagement.
