all levels to speak up and to raise questions and issues. Specific mechanisms include meetings where each member owns an agenda item to ensure they are heard by colleagues. Plan effectively for each engagement and allow breathing room in timescales to avoid resourcing crunches in deadlines squeezing out or shutting down scepticism and challenge. Create a culture of continuous feedback including one in which colleagues are transparent that mistakes happen and focused on how to learn from these and on solutions moving forward. Embed effective hybrid working by utilising virtual channels for informal as well as formal discussion between audit engagement teams, inviting audit managers and junior auditors to calls that would be useful to observe, and maximising the use of face-to-face interactions for socialising between all seniority levels.| Reward & recognition|Build explicit links between specific quality behaviours including scepticism and challenge and remuneration at all levels, not just partners, such as higher salaries for those who have been shown in feedback to be exhibiting the behaviours.| |Identify opportunities for ad hoc feedback and praise to help foster a culture of positive reinforcement when auditors exhibit the behaviours, for example setting time aside in weekly meetings to praise positive examples of scepticism and challenge. Capitalise on audit firm-wide award processes and ensure these are clearly backed internally and therefore meaningful, to reinforce the importance of scepticism and challenge, and provide specific examples of where these behaviours have been applied.| Training, coaching & mentoring|Factor in time for coaching responsibilities into the workload of more senior auditors, particularly those who are taking on coaching responsibilities for the first time and may need time and space to develop soft skills around feedback and coaching. Make formal training as interactive and specific as possible (e.g. role play, case studies, breakout sessions), particularly when delivered
