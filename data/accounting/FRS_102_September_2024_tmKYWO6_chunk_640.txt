have a legal obligation to distribute its profits to its owners at the reporting date, it would have taxable profits and need to recognise a tax expense because paragraph 29.14 prevents the tax effects of dividends being recognised before the dividend itself has been recognised. B29.17 Respondents agreed that, in order to provide more relevant information to users of the financial statements, a pragmatic exception to paragraph 29.14 should be made to permit the tax effects of the gift aid payment to be taken into account when it is probable that the gift aid payment will be made within nine months of the reporting date. This is consistent with the way in which the gift aid relief works for corporation tax purposes in that relief is provided automatically against the taxable profits of the previous period when the gift aid payment is made within nine months of the reporting date. B29.18 One respondent requested greater relief from recognising current and deferred tax expense (income) on the basis that ultimately any profits will be eligible for relief. No further relief has been provided in FRS 102 because the exception in paragraph 29.14A is based on the tax relief expected for the reporting period. Any other tax effects should be recognised when relevant; for example, if an entity does not expect to distribute all of its taxable profits, or has revalued items of property, plant and equipment. Presentation of the tax effects of distributions to owners B29.19 In addition, an amendment has been made to Section 29 Income Tax to clarify that the tax effects of distributions to owners shall be presented in profit or loss, rather than the same component as the underlying transaction. This is because when there is a tax effect arising from the distribution, it affects taxable profits.
