class of members— sections 303 to 305 (members' power to require directors to call general meeting), and section 306 (power of court to order meeting). The following provisions (in addition to those mentioned in subsection (2)) do not apply in relation to a meeting in connection with the variation of the rights of a class of members (a “variation of class rights meeting”)— section 318 (quorum), and section 321 (right to demand a poll). The quorum for a variation of class rights meeting is— for a meeting other than an adjourned meeting, two members of the class present (in person or by proxy) who together represent at least one-third of the voting rights of the class; for an adjourned meeting, one member of the class present (in person or by proxy). At a variation of class rights meeting, any member present (in person or by proxy) may demand a poll. For the purposes of this section— any amendment of a provision contained in a company's articles for the variation of the rights of a class of members, or the insertion of any such provision into the articles, is itself to be treated as a variation of those rights, and references to the variation of rights of a class of members include references to their abrogation.
