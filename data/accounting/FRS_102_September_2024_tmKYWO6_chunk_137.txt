the parent and its subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements shall be prepared as of the same reporting date, and for the same reporting period, unless it is impracticable to do so. Where the reporting date and reporting period of a subsidiary are not the same as the parent’s reporting date and reporting period, the consolidated financial statements must be made up: from the financial statements of the subsidiary as of its last reporting date before the parent’s reporting date, adjusted for the effects of significant transactions or events that occur between the date of those financial statements and the date of the consolidated financial statements, provided that reporting date is no more than three months before that of the parent; or from interim financial statements prepared by the subsidiary as at the parent’s reporting date. Uniform accounting policies Consolidated financial statements shall be prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events and conditions in similar circumstances. If a member of the group uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to its financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries The income and expenses of a subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date, except when a business combination is accounted for by using the merger accounting method under Section 19 or, for certain public benefit entity combinations, Section 34 Specialised Activities. The income and expenses of a subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements until the date on which the parent ceases to control the subsidiary. A parent may cease to control a subsidiary with or without a change in absolute or relative ownership levels.
