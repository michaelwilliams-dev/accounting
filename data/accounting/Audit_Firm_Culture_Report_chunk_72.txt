In particular, these auditors felt that some Committees have a much less clear idea of the overall purpose behind an audit, which creates barriers to understanding why scepticism and challenge are more important now than previously in the industry. “You question if they [Audit Committee members] know why they’re even there, what their role is and what they should be looking to do.” (Partner) The role of the regulator Summary Across most firms and levels, auditors noted that their firm’s focus on scepticism and challenge often mirror the emphasis the regulator (i.e. the FRC) has put on scepticism and challenge, which has led to some effective formalised integration of both behaviours into the audit process. However, for auditors at manager level and above in particular, there was a feeling the regulator could do more. This relates particularly to the perceived need for greater clarification around how the FRC wants audit firms to document scepticism and challenge, as well as support in educating the audited entity on updated audit requirements and ensuring they are held accountable for their role on audits rated as poor quality. What’s working well Absorbing FRC communications into firm-wide practices Auditors and partners felt that communication from the FRC has helped to drive the importance of applying scepticism and challenge when conducting audits.
