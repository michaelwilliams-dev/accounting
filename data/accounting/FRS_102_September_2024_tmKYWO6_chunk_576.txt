B2A.2 In 2018, the IASB completed its post-implementation review of IFRS 13, concluding that it was working as intended.

Comparatives are intended to provide useful information to users, and FRS 102 only provides an exemption from comparatives in limited circumstances reflecting historical company law exemptions. Therefore, in accordance with paragraph 3.14, comparatives
