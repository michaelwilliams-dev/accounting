The entity shall disclose: for the current period, to the extent practicable, the amount of the adjustment to revenue and to profit or loss for the effect of applying the revised Section 23 and an explanation of the reasons for significant changes; or an explanation if it is impracticable to determine the amounts to be disclosed in accordance with (a) above. If an entity applies the revised Section 23 retrospectively in accordance with paragraph 1.61(b), it shall disclose the information required by paragraph 10.13(b) only for the most recent prior period presented (ie the immediately preceding period). An entity may use one or more of the following practical expedients when applying the revised Section 23 retrospectively in accordance with paragraph 1.61(b): for completed contracts, an entity need not restate contracts that: begin and end within the same annual reporting period; or are completed contracts at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
