high workloads and busy periods. For example, auditors reported hearing less about scepticism and challenge from senior colleagues part-way through engagements where there was particular time pressure (e.g. where delays arose from ineffective project or stakeholder management which had led to more tasks or changes to the timeline). Some auditors felt that some senior auditors can also default to communicating frequently or intensely about the importance of a deadline during busy periods, which can discourage effective challenge and professional scepticism. However, even when junior auditors felt scepticism and challenge had been verbally emphasised in busy periods, they still often felt that these were in tension with the high levels of pressure being passed down from senior colleagues, reducing the impact of this communication. Additionally, communication about the importance of getting audits right over the importance of deadlines isn’t always possible for senior associates and managers to put into practice; auditors at these levels often felt they had already been committed to another engagement and that it was therefore challenging to push back deadlines to enable more scepticism and challenge without making their workload unsustainable in the long run. “Pushing back on a deadline doesn’t always benefit you as the workload catches up on you and you therefore have to “fix” things you can’t really.” (Assistant manager / Manager) Several auditors felt that firm-wide formal communication can also be an ineffective driver and prompt around quality during busy times, as more generic, untailored emails and newsletters get lost or buried in their inboxes amongst priority engagement-related messages, resulting in them going unread. Ineffective embedding of new ways of working limiting informal communication New hybrid ways of working following the Covid-19 pandemic, when not embedded properly, were also seen to have introduced several new barriers to effective communication enabling scepticism and challenge
