(which might be zero) that the entity would receive for the asset if it were to be sold at the reporting date. Reversal If, in a subsequent period, the amount of an impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the entity shall reverse the previously recognised impairment loss either directly or by adjusting an allowance account. The reversal shall not result in a carrying amount of the financial asset (net of any allowance account) that exceeds what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not previously been recognised. The entity shall recognise the amount of the reversal in profit or loss immediately. ‒11.32 [Deleted] Derecognition of a financial asset An entity shall derecognise a financial asset only when: the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are settled; or the entity transfers to another party substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset; or the entity, despite having retained some, but not substantially all, risks and rewards of ownership, has transferred control of the asset to another party and the other party has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without needing to impose additional restrictions on the transfer. In this case, the entity shall: derecognise the asset; and recognise separately any rights and obligations retained or created in the transfer. The carrying amount of the transferred asset shall be allocated between the rights or obligations retained and those transferred on the basis of their relative fair values at the transfer date. Newly created rights and obligations shall be measured
