team structure and audit engagement structure encourage a two-way dialogue and effective relationship-building between junior and senior auditors (e.g. regular team meetings, managers sitting next to junior auditors during the day). This can help to create less of a hierarchy between levels, encouraging junior auditors to ask questions and approach senior colleagues for advice. This also helps junior auditors develop soft skills and confidence. By delivering interactive formal training Auditors are most likely to engage and learn from formal training when it is designed to be interactive, whether on- or offline, for example including role play or breakout discussions. Interactive formats can also help to maximise engagement in the sessions, even if delivered virtually, and reduce the risk of auditors completing other tasks when they should be engaging in training. This may be enhanced by keeping training sessions succinct and ‘bitesize’ during busy periods, so that auditors feel more able to attend. By putting tangible, real-life examples at the heart of formal training The most effective formal training helps auditors to translate theory into practice. As above, using role play techniques and working through real case studies of prior audit engagements are both effective ways to help auditors understand how to apply scepticism and challenge as part of their roles. Involving senior auditors in these sessions, either by asking them to facilitate or simply to attend to help to field questions, reasserts to junior auditors that scepticism and challenge are positive behaviours supported and expected by the firm.

They felt there has been a move away from prioritising profit, which has facilitated greater application
