adjustments made onto a modified statutory solvency basis (MSSB) for the purposes of the financial statements (for example, to adjust liabilities to exclude certain additional reserves included in the liabilities when measured on the statutory solvency basis, or where future income included in the VIF covers deferred acquisition costs included in the statement of financial position). A corresponding adjustment to the value of in-force policies will need to be made in order to ensure a consistent valuation. IG1.7 Paragraph IG1.4 explains that the value calculated must be adjusted to ensure consistency where adjustments have been made onto the MSSB measurement basis in relation to non-participating contracts. The measurement of the VIF asset may take into account the release of capital requirements for non-participating business. It would not be appropriate to recognise this release of capital requirements within the VIF asset presented in the accounts because the MSSB liabilities do not include an allowance for capital. Therefore the amount of the VIF asset should be adjusted accordingly. IG1.8 The profit recognition profile for non-participating contracts which do not satisfy FRS 103â€™s definition of an insurance contract or contain a discretionary participation feature will be determined by the requirements of Sections 11 Basic Financial Instruments, 12 Other Financial Instruments Issues and 23 Revenue of FRS 102. Where these contracts are written in a with-profits fund, paragraph IG1.4 will apply but the VIF recognised for such contracts should be adjusted to reflect the difference in the profit recognition bases between the basis used to determine the VIF taken into account in determining the realistic value of liabilities and the profit recognition profile determined by FRS 102. IG1.9 Paragraph 3.12(d) of FRS 103 permits that when a with-profits fund has an interest in a subsidiary or associate and the determination of the realistic value
