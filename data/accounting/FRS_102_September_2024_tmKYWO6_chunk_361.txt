upon satisfying specified vesting conditions related to service or performance. An example of a service condition is when a grant of shares or share options is conditional on the employee remaining in the entity’s employ for a specified period of time. Examples of performance conditions are when a grant of shares or share options is conditional on the entity achieving a specified growth in profit (a non-market vesting condition) or a specified increase in the entity’s share price (a market vesting condition). Vesting conditions and conditions that are not vesting conditions (such as a condition that an employee contributes to a savings plan) are accounted for as follows: Vesting conditions, other than market vesting conditions, shall not be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares or share options at the measurement date. Instead, such vesting conditions shall be taken into account in estimating the number of equity instruments expected to vest. Subsequently, the entity shall revise that estimate, if new information indicates that the number of equity instruments expected to vest differs from previous estimates. On the vesting date, the entity shall revise the estimate to equal the number of equity instruments that ultimately vested. All market vesting conditions and conditions that are not vesting conditions shall be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the equity instruments granted at the measurement date, with no subsequent adjustment to the estimated fair value, irrespective of the outcome of the market vesting condition or condition that is not a vesting condition, provided that all other vesting conditions are satisfied. Shares An entity shall measure the fair value of shares (and the related goods or services received) using the following three-tier measurement hierarchy: If an observable market price is available for the equity instruments granted, use that
