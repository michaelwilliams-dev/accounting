through profit and loss and the change is recognised in a way analogous with the recognition and presentation of actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions. This is a pragmatic solution to achieve consistency in accounting practices that results in the costs recognised in profit or loss for the period being solely those usually required by the respective accounting approaches, and the impact of the change in approach being presented as a single line in other comprehensive income. B28.8G The difference to be recognised in other comprehensive income shall be limited to the effects of the transition and excludes: any changes in the liability for the contributions payable arising from an agreement to fund a deficit, which arise, and shall be accounted for, prior to the relevant date (such changes might relate to payments made, interest on the liability and changes to the underlying agreement); the impact of any plan changes, curtailments or settlements occurring at the relevant date (see paragraph 28.11D); and the impact of any plan changes, curtailments or settlements that occur between the relevant date and the reporting date. B28.8H Paragraph 5.5A(a) requires items in other comprehensive income to be classified by nature. Therefore, to ensure that the effect of the transition from defined contribution accounting to defined benefit accounting is distinguishable from any other items relating to post-employment benefits, paragraph 28.11B(b) requires the difference on transition to be presented separately in other comprehensive income. FRS 102 already includes disclosure requirements that are relevant to the transition from defined contribution accounting to defined benefit accounting, such as those relating to accounting policies, significant judgements, defined benefit plans, amounts to be recognised in other comprehensive income and general requirements to provide information that is relevant to an understanding of the financial statements.
