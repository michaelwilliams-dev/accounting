Act 2006) Regulations 2008, may elect to retain its accounting policies for reported assets, liabilities and equity at the date of transition to this FRS until there is any change to those balances or the micro-entity undertakes any new transactions that would cause the company to cease to be dormant within the Actâ€™s definition or the LLP to cease to be dormant within the relevant definition. Lease incentives A first-time adopter is not required to apply paragraphs 15.15 and 15.25 to lease incentives provided the term of the lease commenced before the date of transition to this FRS. The first-time adopter shall continue to recognise any residual benefit or cost associated with these lease incentives on the same basis as that applied at the date of transition to this FRS. Revenue from contracts with customers A first-time adopter is not required to restate completed contracts that begin and end within the comparative reporting period. For completed contracts that have variable consideration and are completed before the reporting date, a first-time adopter may use the transaction price at the date the contract was completed rather than estimating variable consideration amounts in the comparative reporting periods. A completed contract is a contract for which the micro-entity has transferred all of the goods or services identified in accordance with its previous financial reporting framework or Section 18 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. If it is impracticable for a micro-entity to make one or more of the adjustments required by paragraph 28.7 at the date of transition, the micro-entity shall apply paragraphs 28.7 to 28.10 for such adjustments in the earliest period for which it is practicable to do so. Where applicable to the transactions, events or arrangements affected by applying these exemptions, a micro-entity may continue to use the exemptions that are applied
