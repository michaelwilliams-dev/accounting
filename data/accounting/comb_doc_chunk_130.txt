at the inception of the lease, that the option will be exercised. the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset even if title is not transferred. at the inception of the lease the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset. the leased assets are of such a specialised nature that only the lessee can use them without major modifications. (FRS 102 paragraph 20.5) Gives a list of secondary considerations that might also lead to finance lease classification. (FRS 102 paragraph 20.6) However there is no direct equivalent to the ‘bright line’ 90% test under SSAP 21.| Both standards aim to identify those situations where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are held by a lessee, but use different specific tests or indicators. Therefore, there are unlikely to be many cases where the lease classification will change as a result of applying of FRS 102. Example 1 Lease classification – Specialised assets This example is designed to illustrate the different elements of the lease classification decision-making process and may not be representative of a typical lease seen in practice. Facts Company A leases a bespoke piece of machinery from Company B. The machinery was constructed for use in Company A’s specialist business, to its specification and is used in producing an item for which Company A holds the patent, so a third party would not legally be able to use the machinery without significant alteration. The lease is for a period of seven years and the expected useful life of the machinery is at least 10 years. The present value of the minimum future lease payments is 70% of the asset’s fair value at inception.
