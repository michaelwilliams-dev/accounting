with the financial reporting implications associated with the replacement of interest rate benchmarks as part of the international interest rate benchmark reforms. These amendments are referred to as Phase 2 of the interest rate benchmark reform related amendments to FRS 102. The Phase 1 amendments relate to hedge accounting (see paragraphs B11.69 to B11.75). B11.49C For the purposes of these amendments, interest rate benchmark reform refers to the market-wide reform of an interest rate benchmark, including the replacement of an interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate such as that resulting from the recommendations set out in the Financial Stability Board’s July 2014 report Reforming Major Interest Rate Benchmarks. B11.49D Similarly to Phase 1, as this is a global systemic issue, the FRC did not want to develop a financial reporting solution in isolation from other relevant developments. Therefore these amendments are based on the IASB’s Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16. Changes were made to reflect existing differences between IFRS and FRS 102. The amendments were supported by respondents. B11.49E FRS 102 permits an accounting policy choice between the requirements of Section 11 and Section 12 of FRS 102 and the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS 9 or IAS 39. The amendments to FRS 102 ensure that equivalent relief is available to all entities applying FRS 102, regardless of their accounting policy choice in relation to financial instruments. B11.49F A new practical expedient requires entities to account for changes to contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform, as if they were a re-estimation of the cash flows of a variable rate financial instrument. The re-estimation of the cash flows is not expected to change the carrying amount of the financial asset
