accounting A3.30 Paragraph 10 of Schedule 6 to the Regulations states: ‘The conditions for accounting for an acquisition as a merger are— that the undertaking whose shares are acquired is ultimately controlled by the same party both before and after the acquisition, that the control referred to in paragraph (a) is not transitory, and that adoption of the merger method accords with generally accepted accounting principles or practice.’ Therefore, paragraph 10 of Schedule 6 to the Regulations permits the use of merger accounting in certain limited circumstances, which is generally consistent with paragraph 19.27 of FRS 102 (group reconstructions). If an entity considers that, for the overriding purpose of giving a true and fair view, merger accounting should be applied in circumstances other than those set out in paragraph 10 of Schedule 6 to the Regulations, it may do so providing the relevant disclosures are made in the notes to the financial statements.

FRS 102 therefore does not extend the use of merger accounting beyond its applicability in company law, or other relevant statutory framework. If a public benefit entity that is a company considers that, for the overriding purpose of giving a true and fair view, merger accounting should be applied in circumstances other than those set out in paragraph 10 of Schedule 6 to the Regulations, it may do so providing the relevant disclosures are made in the notes to the financial statements.
