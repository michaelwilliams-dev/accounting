Therefore, if the issuer concludes that the issuer’s profits are ‘a non-financial variable specific to a party to a contract’ and that the instrument could not otherwise be measured at fair value under adopted IFRS, then it must measure the instrument at amortised cost, rather than at fair value, in accordance with paragraph 12.8(c).| Examples of financial instruments that would normally satisfy the conditions in paragraph 11.9 are: trade accounts and notes receivable and payable, and loans from banks or other third parties; accounts payable in a foreign currency.
