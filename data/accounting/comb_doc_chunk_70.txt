deferred payment terms When goods or services are sold on credit, the arrangement has in substance two components, firstly the sale of the goods or services and secondly a financing element. The two components are accounted for separately. To that effect a seller recognises the revenue from the sale in accordance with Section 23 Revenue of FRS 102 and a purchaser recognises the acquired goods and services in accordance with the applicable accounting requirements in FRS 102. When the arrangement is a financing transaction, ie when the payment for goods or services is deferred beyond normal business terms or the sale is financed at a below market rate of interest, the trade debtor (or trade creditor) is measured at the present value of the cash flows receivable or payable discounted at the market rate of interest for a similar receivable or payable (paragraph 11.13). In practice, an entity may use the current cash selling price for the goods or services sold on an arm’s length basis as an estimate for the present value of the future payments. However, if there is no cash sale alternative or the cash selling price is the same as the price when buying on credit, the entity must calculate the present value of the future cash flows. The following numerical example demonstrates the accounting by a seller (the manufacturer) and a buyer (the customer) when payment is deferred. Example 1: The sale of goods on deferred payment terms A manufacturer sells a piece of machinery to a customer on credit for CU1,000 on 1 January 20X0, agreeing with the customer that full payment is due in two years’ time on 31 December 20X1. Under normal business terms the piece of machinery is sold for cash and the current cash selling price is CU900. Sales taxes
