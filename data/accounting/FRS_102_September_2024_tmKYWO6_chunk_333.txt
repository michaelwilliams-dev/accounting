for another of the same type, quality, condition and price (eg one colour or size for another) are not considered returns for the purposes of applying the requirements in paragraphs 23.53 to 23.56. To account for revenue for the transfer of products with a right of return (and for some services that are provided subject to a refund), an entity shall recognise the following: revenue only for products expected not to be returned; a refund liability for consideration received (or receivable) for products expected to be returned; and a refund asset, classified as inventory, for products expected to be returned (and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales). To determine the amount of consideration that should be recognised in accordance with paragraph 23.53(a), an entity shall apply paragraphs 23.41 to 23.47. The amount of consideration received (or receivable) that is not recognised as revenue shall be recognised as a refund liability in accordance with paragraph 23.53(b). A refund asset recognised by an entity in accordance with paragraph 23.53(c) shall initially be measured at the former carrying amount of the product (eg inventory), less: any expected costs to recover those products; and allowances for potential decreases in the value to the entity of those products (eg because of damage, obsolescence or declining selling prices). At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall update its assessment of products expected to be returned. The entity shall: recognise changes in the amount of revenue recognised as adjustments to the refund liability, and vice versa; and recognise adjustments to the asset recognised for products expected to be returned in cost of sales. Contracts in which a customer may return a defective product in exchange for a functioning product shall be evaluated in accordance with the guidance on warranties in paragraphs 23.26 to 23.28.
