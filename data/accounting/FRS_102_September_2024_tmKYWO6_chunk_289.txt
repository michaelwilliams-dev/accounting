is for the major part of the economic life of the underlying asset even if title is not transferred; at the inception date, the present value of the lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset; and the underlying asset is of such a specialised nature that only the lessee can use it without major modifications. Indicators of situations that individually or in combination could also lead to a lease being classified as a finance lease are: if the lessee can cancel the lease, the lessorâ€™s losses associated with the cancellation are borne by the lessee; gains or losses from the fluctuation in the fair value of the residual accrue to the lessee (eg in the form of a rent rebate equalling most of the sales proceeds at the end of the lease); and the lessee has the ability to continue the lease for a secondary period at a rent that is substantially lower than market rent. The examples and indicators in paragraphs 20.88 and 20.89 are not always conclusive. If it is clear from other features that the lease does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset, the lease is classified as an operating lease. For example, this may be the case if ownership of the underlying asset transfers at the end of the lease for a variable payment equal to its then fair value, or if there are variable lease payments, as a result of which the lessor does not transfer substantially all such risks and rewards. Lease classification is made at the inception date and is reassessed only if there is a lease modification. Changes in estimates (eg changes in estimates of the economic life or of the residual value of
