economic effects. FRS 102 Under FRS 102, the arrangement should be analysed to determine whether it conveys the right for Company D to use the substation in return for payments. In this case, Company D has obtained the right to use the substation because it has been built only to meet its needs. It should therefore be accounted for as a lease. Depending on the details of the arrangement, both parties would account for the arrangement either as an operating lease (with Company C showing income and Company D showing expense relating to the use of the substation, distinct from that for the supply of electricity) or as a finance lease, so the substation would be shown as an asset on Company D’s books rather than Company C’s. If it is a finance lease, Company C would recognise a receivable equal to the net investment in the lease. Current UK accounting standards focus on the likelihood of their being variations in the profits or losses (or cash flows) arising from the use of the property subject to the arrangement and FRS 102 focuses on whether there is a right to use the specific asset. However, in considering whether an entity has a right to use an asset, it is likely entities will consider factors such as the variability of the price to be paid. In both cases the intended result is the recognition of the substance of the arrangement and UITF Information Sheet 86 Status of Adoption into UK GAAP of IFRIC Interpretations (recently updated as http://www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Publications/Accounting-and-Reporting-Policy/Status-of- Adoption-into-UK-GAAP-of-IFRIC-Interpret.aspx) noted that IFRIC 4 (from which these requirements of FRS 102 were developed) is already addressed in UK GAAP. However, entities with service contracts (such as outsourcing arrangements, telecommunication contracts that provide rights to capacity, and take-or-pay contracts) should review whether they
