for amortisation are set out in paragraphs 18.19 to 18.24. 18.18C The revaluation model does not allow: the revaluation of intangible assets that have not previously been recognised as assets; or the initial recognition of intangible assets at amounts other than cost. 18.18D Revaluations shall be made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period. 18.18E If the fair value of a revalued intangible asset can no longer be determined by reference to an active market in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 18.18B, the carrying amount of the asset shall be its revalued amount at the date of the last revaluation by reference to the active market, less any subsequent accumulated amortisation and any subsequent accumulated impairment losses. 18.18F The revaluation model is applied after an asset has been initially recognised at cost. However, if only part of the cost of an intangible asset is recognised as an asset because the asset did not meet the criteria for recognition until part of the way through the process (see paragraph 18.10A), the revaluation model may be applied to the whole of that asset. Reporting gains and losses on revaluations 18.18G If an asset’s carrying amount is increased as a result of a revaluation, the increase shall be recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. However, the increase shall be recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
