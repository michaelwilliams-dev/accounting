life, the life shall not exceed 10 years. On acquisition in 2015, Entity B determined that the goodwill had an economic life of 15 years. At 31 December 2018 the carrying amount for the goodwill is therefore CU7,333 and has a remaining useful life of 11 years. 19.23(a) Examples Entity B still considers the remaining useful economic life of that goodwill to be 11 years and can provide adequate evidence to support this. It is therefore not required to adjust the expected amortisation profile. Measurement of other acquired assets and liabilities In accordance with Section 35, Entity B decides not to apply the requirements of Section 19 Business Combinations and Goodwill retrospectively to the acquired assets and liabilities. Entity B is still required to recognise and measure those acquired assets and liabilities that remain within the group at the date of transition in accordance with the other first-time adoption accounting requirements set out in paragraphs 35.7 to 35.10 of FRS 102. Entity B determines that no adjustments to the acquired assets and liabilities are required in accordance with the first-time adoption accounting requirements of FRS 102, except for deferred tax. Paragraph 29.6 of FRS 102 requires the recognition of deferred tax on all timing differences. Entity B still owns the acquired property, plant and equipment which were fair valued on the date of acquisition. Entity B measures the deferred tax liability on the fair value adjustments (to the extent that they have not been reduced by depreciation prior to the date of transition) based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the date of transition and records the corresponding adjustment in equity.
