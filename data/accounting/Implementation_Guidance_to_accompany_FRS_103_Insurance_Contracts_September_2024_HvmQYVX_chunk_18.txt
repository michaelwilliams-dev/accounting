business. IG2.38 Balance sheet liabilities item C.4 (Provision for bonuses and rebates) and line II.7 (Bonuses and rebates, net of reinsurance) in the technical account for long-term business should not be used. Bonuses and rebates attributable to the reporting period, other than those included within claims payable, should be included in line II.6(a) (Change in other technical provisions â€“ long term business provision) and in Balance Sheet Liabilities item C.2 (Long term business provision). Long-term business provision Paragraphs IG2.39 to IG2.44 provide guidance for applying the requirements of paragraph 52 of Schedule 3 to the Regulations. They are only relevant to long-term insurance business. IG2.39 The gross premium method should be used for every class of insurance business except those for which the net premium method is used in the related regulatory returns, but policyholder liabilities of overseas subsidiaries may be computed on a local basis, subject to Part 3 of Schedule 6 to the Regulations. IG2.40 Where the valuation is performed using a net premium method, bonuses should be included in the long-term business provision only if they have vested or have been declared as a result of the current valuation. IG2.41 Liabilities should be measured on a basis consistent with the bases adopted for valuing the corresponding assets. In determining the long-term business provision and the technical provision for linked liabilities, no policy may have an overall negative provision except as allowed by PRA rules, or a provision which is less than any guaranteed surrender or transfer value. IG2.42 The long-term business provision may be calculated on the basis used for regulatory reporting subject to appropriate adjustments including the reversal of any reduction in policyholder liabilities where these liabilities already implicitly take account of a pension fund surplus through future expense assumptions which reflect lower expected contributions.
