Loans, most commonly loans between related parties, may be financed at an interest rate that is lower than the rate that would typically be charged for a similar loan or the loan may even be interest- free. FRS 102 refers to these types of lending arrangements as financing transactions.

This Education Note provides guidance on the application of the measurement requirements in FRS 102 applicable to financing transactions. It also sets out a comparative analysis of the key accounting requirements for financing transactions under FRS 102 and those applicable under previous UK and Irish GAAP.
