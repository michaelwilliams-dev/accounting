the audit opinion. Developing approaches to the audit through the application of technology may replace the sampling approach and substitute more sophisticated analysis of all transactions in any given system. This requires very different skills in information analysis and exception examination. Further consideration on this topic is included in the FRC’s guidance on Addressing Exceptions In The Use of Data Analytics. The revisions recently made to ISA (UK) 240 (The auditor’s responsibilities relating to fraud in an audit of financial statements) remind auditors that the inherent limitations of an audit ‘does not diminish the auditor’s responsibility to plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement due to fraud’. Whilst the knowledge and understanding of the business model will drive certain audit risks, it is necessary to consider the risk of fraud particularly carefully. Fraud risks may differ substantially from the risks over normal business transactions. Other revisions, such as enhanced discussion with those charged with governance over fraud risks, will help ensure that auditors consider the risk of material misstatement due to fraud appropriately. ISA (UK) 240 is already clear that auditors must, for example, be alert to the possibility of linked transactions which individually are below materiality but may be disguising a material fraud.

This is essential to ensure that less experienced members of the team, who are more likely to be undertaking the audit work, are alert to potential “red flags”. Planning includes ensuring that the audit team is appropriately resourced at all levels, considering both the skills necessary and the time
