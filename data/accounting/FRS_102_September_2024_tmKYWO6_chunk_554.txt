Section 12 Other Financial Instruments Issues. The various options for setting out the requirements for entities engaged in insurance business were considered, and a separate accounting standard on insurance contracts, FRS 103 Insurance Contracts, was developed and issued in March 2014. The Basis for Conclusions to FRS 103 accompanies that standard. Initial effective date of FRS 102 Early consultations proposed an effective date for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2013, with early application being permitted. Respondentsâ€™ views regarding these proposals were very mixed with some calling for earlier adoption and others for deferral. Key points relevant to setting the initial effective date were: An 18-month period between the publication of the final standard and effective date should be retained as there are significant changes to the accounting requirements for financial instruments. The effective date needed to take into consideration the updating of the SORPs that was required. It was concluded that the effective date of FRS 102 should be accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015. In relation to early application of FRS 102, it was noted that as FRS 102 represents an improvement in financial reporting it would not be appropriate to prevent early application of its requirements. Early application of FRS 102 was permitted for accounting periods ending on or after 31 December 2012, which was consistent with the first date at which it was likely to be practical for entities applying FRS 101 to apply that standard. Given that the SORPs required updating for consistency with FRS 102, early application was permitted for entities applying a SORP provided that FRS 102 did not conflict with the requirements of a current SORP or legal requirements for the preparation of financial statements.
