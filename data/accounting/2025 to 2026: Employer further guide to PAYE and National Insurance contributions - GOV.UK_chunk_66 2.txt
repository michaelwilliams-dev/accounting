Alternatively, read about what to do if your employee has more than 1 job . This example tells you how to work out National Insurance contributions when earnings from more than one job are added together and the jobs have di " erent earnings periods. Example 1 Jason is 19, and his earnings are: £300 a week (category M) £2,000 a month (category M) JasonÕs earnings period is weekly, and his monthly earnings will be added to his weekly earnings in the week theyÕre paid. There will be 40 weeks where Jason earned £300 and 12 weeks where Jason earned £2,300. This is how the National Insurance contributions are worked out. Week 1, Jason earns £300, all at category M. Employee contributions are due at 8% on earnings above the PT . EmployeeÕs contribution: (£300 Ð £242) + 8% 58 + 8% = £4.64 Employer contributions are due at 0% on earnings above the ST (£96) up to the UST (£967): EmployerÕs contribution: (£300 Ð £96) + 0% 204 + 0% = £0.00 For the 40 weeks where Jason only receives his weekly salary: Category: M Employee National Insurance contributions: £4.64 Employer National Insurance contributions: £0.00 In 12 weeks of the year, Jason receives his monthly salary as well as his weekly salary. Employee contributions are due at 8% on earnings above the weekly PT up to the weekly UEL and at 2% above the weekly UEL . EmployeeÕs contribution: (£967 Ð £242) = £725 + 8% = £58.00 (£2,300 Ð £967) = £1,333 + 2% = £26.66 £58.00 + £26.66 = £84.66 Employer contributions are due at 0% on earnings above the ST up to the UST and 15% above the UST . For the 12 weeks where Jason receives both his weekly and monthly salary: EmployerÕs contribution: (£967 Ð £96) = £871 + 0% = 0.00 (£2,300 Ð £967) = £1,333 + 15% = £199.95 Category: M Employee National Insurance contributions: £84.66 Employer National Insurance contributions: £199.95 Total employee National Insurance contributions: (£4.64 + 40) + (£84.66 + 12) = £185.60 + £1,015.92 = £1,201.52 Total employer National Insurance contributions: (0.00 + 40) + (£199.95 + 12) = 0.00 + £2,399.40 = £2,399.40 Reporting National Insurance contributions when earnings from separate jobs are added together If an employee has one payroll identity add together all the payments made in one earnings period under one category and report National Insurance contributions data on the total amount.
