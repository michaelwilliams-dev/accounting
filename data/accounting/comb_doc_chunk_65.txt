the holder is a fixed amount of nil. Therefore the fact that it is interest-free does not prevent classification as basic. If a loan meets the conditions in paragraph 11.9 it is classified as basic and there is no need to consider the requirements of paragraph 11.9A. However, if other features of an interest-free loan mean that it fails to meet any of the other conditions in paragraph 11.9, it is unlikely that it would meet the requirements of paragraph 11.9A and would then be classified as other. For a loan to be considered basic in accordance with paragraph 11.9A there must be reasonable compensation for the time value of money, credit risk and other basic lending risks which, subject to prevailing economic conditions, is unlikely to be the case if a loan is interest-free.
