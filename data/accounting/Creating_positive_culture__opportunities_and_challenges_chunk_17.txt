only the company’s achievement but also the challenges that might lie ahead. Such openness will help NEDs to understand why decisions are being made. Leaders, through their decisions, actions and interactions, need to exemplify transparency, honesty and trust, and other organisational values and behaviours, and the board needs to hold them to account on this commitment. Their visibility with employees at all levels of their organisations is integral to successful embedding of culture. On the contrary, if there are mixed messages coming from the top about culture, values and behaviours, this may lead not only lead to confusion but also distrust between workers and company leaders. Actions that have helped enable transparency and bolster trust in company leadership include using board ‘deep dives’ that put a spotlight on a specific topic, business unit or location, and look beyond headline figures that may give a false sense of comfort. They can be used to better understand issues of the moment, find out more about programmes/projects, and to deepen understanding of the data presented to the board by executives. To strengthen the system of controls and to build trust into the data reported to the board, different functions across an organisation, including audit, risk and ethics & compliance, can and should periodically do deep dives. Ensuring a degree of professional scepticism and inquisitiveness is key to be able to scratch below the surface. In one company deep dives were initiated by the Chair, giving board members an opportunity to go out into the business to meet people to listen to their challenges and ideas. By asking probing questions, directors should be better equipped to consider whether company culture is having a positive impact on strategy. With clear objectives deep dives are far more effective than ad-hoc site visits, which often feel ‘staged’.
