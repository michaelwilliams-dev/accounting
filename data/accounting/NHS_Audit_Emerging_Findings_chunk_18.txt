suggestions for changes to existing requirements and frameworks: Amendments to reporting frameworks, including: Rationalisation of Annual Report requirements for NHS bodies, including re- considering which elements are required to be subject to audit (e.g. remuneration and staff report disclosures). Simplifying financial reporting requirements relating to valuation of property. Amendments to audit and assurance frameworks, such as: Clarifying or relaxing the requirements of the NAO�s Auditor Guidance Note 1 in relation to provision of non-audit services in ICB areas where firms provide external audit services to bodies within that ICB, and whether these represent conflicts of interest from an ethical perspective. Reconsidering whether the VFM arrangements work required under the NAO�s Code of Audit Practice is adding value or providing new information to NHS bodies, in the context of wider scrutiny from regulators, and therefore whether requiring this work remains in the public interest. Removing of the requirement for external assurance over ICBs compliance with the Mental Health Investment Standard, with the potential to replace this with self- certification. Reconsideration of regulatory frameworks: Increasing the MLA threshold for NHS bodies to enable regulatory focus on the entities of highest risk or excluding ICBs from the definition of an MLA. Reconsidering whether KAPs should be required to sign the audit opinions for NHS bodies and/or enable a more straightforward pathway for corporate auditors to do so. In the next phase of the market study, we will be exploring these, and any other, suggestions for changes in more detail. We will be seeking to identify what, if any, actions should be taken in response to issues identified in the NHS audit market. Such actions may be informed by various factors including the unique features of NHS audits, how NHS and local government audits differ, and any similarities between NHS and corporate audits.
