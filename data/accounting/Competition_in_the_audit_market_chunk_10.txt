fees from the ‘unlisted credit institutions and insurers’ and ‘listed debt’ categories. Audit market shares There remains high concentration in the audit market. In 2021, the Big Four audit firms (Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC) earned 92% of PIE audit fees compared with 96% in 2020.8 In 2021, the Big Four earned 98% of FTSE 350 audit fees.9 Excluding the FTSE 350, the Big Four earned over 70% of all other PIE audit fees. 10 Figure 2 below shows the proportion of PIE audit fees earned by each audit firm in 2020 and 2021. 11 Figure 2.

However, most of these firms supply only a few audits. In 2021, only 14 of the 37 firms active in the PIE market supplied more than 10 PIE audits.12 The numbers of firms auditing different types of PIEs have remained broadly similar over recent years, although there has been an increase in the number of firms auditing FTSE 250 companies (from six firms in 2018 to nine in 2021). Only the Big Four audited FTSE 100 companies over this period.

For data availability reasons, this is calculated at the network level; therefore, a figure calculated on a UK- firm-only basis may be slightly different. 10 This is an estimate derived from the Big Four’s overall PIE market share (at UK firm level) and their
