Recognition and measurement requirements consistent with FRS 102 The reporting requirements for all entities (including small and micro-entities) are based on FRS 102 because it improves consistency across the financial reporting framework in the UK and Republic of Ireland. To that end, FRS 105 applies the recognition and measurement requirements of FRS 102, adapted when necessary to reflect the legal requirements of the micro-entities regime and simplified further to reflect the size and nature of micro-entities. It was noted that some of the simplifications made in FRS 105, including the omission of some of the disclosures required by FRS 102, would not have been introduced if they had not been necessary to ensure legal compliance with the micro-entities regime. For example, the FRC continues to believe that investment property should always, when practicable, be measured at fair value as this provides more relevant information to users of the financial statements of a companyâ€™s financial position and performance. However, company law prohibits the revaluation of any asset by micro-entities applying the micro-entities regime, and instead requires that fixed assets are measured at cost less depreciation and impairment. Structure and language of FRS 105 A number of respondents to the initial consultations suggested that the accessibility of FRS 105 could be enhanced by departing from the section and paragraph numbering of FRS 102. Consequently, FRS 105 maintains consistency with the language and terminology used in FRS 102 (when possible) but uses its own unique section and paragraph numbering. Amendments to FRS 102 to align FRS 105 with the legal requirements Scope FRS 105 is applicable to the preparation of the financial statements of a micro-entity which are presumed in law to give a true and fair view in accordance with the micro-entities
