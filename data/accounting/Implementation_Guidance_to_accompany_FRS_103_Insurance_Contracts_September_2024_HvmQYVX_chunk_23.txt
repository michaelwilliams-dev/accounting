and Formats of Schedule 3 to the Regulations, and the requirements of paragraphs 3.5 and 9.13(a) of FRS 102. They are relevant to general insurance business and to long-term insurance business. IG2.59 Where the amounts of general or long-term business are not material, the results should be disclosed as ‘other technical income, net of reinsurance’ or ‘other technical charges, net of reinsurance’ in the technical account for the business which is material. Appropriate additional disclosure should be made in the notes to the financial statements in relation to the business accounted for in this way. IG2.60 On consolidation, the profit or loss of any non-insurance entity belonging to the long- term fund (as defined in INSPRU as at 31 December 2015) may be included directly in the technical account for long-term business. Where material, more detailed disclosure should be provided in the notes to the financial statements. Where an entity carrying on general insurance business is an asset of the long-term insurance business, the profit or loss of this business should be transferred from the non-technical account to the technical account for long-term business using new lines for this purpose. Valuation of reinsurance asset Paragraph IG2.61 provides guidance on the application of Section 2 Concepts and Pervasive Principles of FRS 102. IG2.61 Assets created by reinsurance transactions should be measured on a basis consistent with the measurement of the related liability, so that the net amount reflects the exposure of the entity. Changing the measurement of the liability may therefore give rise to a change in the related reinsurance asset. An exception to this paragraph is where a provision is made for any shortfall in value (eg any anticipated inability on the part of the reinsurer to meet its obligations to the cedant, when they are expected to fall due).
