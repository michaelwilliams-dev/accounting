also encouraged. Ensuring that the efforts remain effective and appropriate for the organisation’s strategic objectives and business model is essential. One way of approaching effectiveness and impact review may be looking out for trends which would point towards the desired culture becoming accepted or directly engaging stakeholders to gather feedback. Some companies hire external consultants who use specialist tools while others conduct it through internal functions. Spotlight – From assurance to action plan (cooperative approach) Equiniti Group plc, through partnership between its HR and Internal Audit functions, has been developing an innovative approach to auditing its culture and behaviours. The process starts with conducting an employee engagement survey, using Gallup – an externally recognised approach. However, this is not the only input. ‘Clearly, your engagement is a key part of culture, no question. But one of my concerns with that, is you could have people not actually realising why they like or dislike the workplace, or you could even have lots of people who are very engaged but in a really toxic culture.’ Andrew Stephenson, HR Director, Equiniti Group plc The surveys are followed by the Top Employers Institute or Investors in People assessment results – systems that audit company activities, instead of workers’ perception of their employer. The two inputs are then put into a simple two-by-two grid which identifies: ‘Things we’re doing well, and people recognise and like’ – narrative to promote; ‘Things that we think we’re doing, but people don’t like or don’t mention’ – items for further consideration; ‘Things that people think we’re doing that we aren’t’; and ‘Things we aren’t doing that people would really like us to’. |Identified in employee engagement survey|Not identified in employee engagement survey/areas of development in engagement survey| Identified by external review|‘Things we’re do-ing well, and people recognise and like’|‘Things
