Although not part of this paper, we also recognise the important contribution that the management of the audited entity and those charged with governance can make to a robust and comprehensive audit. A well governed company, which reports transparently, and has clear and robust evidence that underpins that reporting, as well as effective internal controls are all important in underpinning a high-quality audit. The FRC is committed to working with audit firms, and other stakeholders, to improve audit quality and, as a result, ensure better outcomes for stakeholders who rely on the accuracy and integrity of a companyâ€™s financial performance and prospects. This paper does not provide a definitive answer to what a good audit looks like, but we hope this is a helpful contribution to inform the debate amongst all our stakeholders about what constitutes a good audit and a high performing audit practice, which are inextricably linked.
