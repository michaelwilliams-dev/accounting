is that the interest on the loan increases as and when the variable rate decreases and vice versa (so called inverse floating interest). In accordance with paragraph 11.9(a)(iv) the combination of positive or negative fixed rate and positive variable rate is a permitted return. The variable rate (6-month IBOR) meets the definition of a variable rate, as the rate is a quoted interest rate. However, since the variable rate is negative (minus 6-month IBOR), the rate is in breach of the condition in paragraph 11.9(a)(iv). The inverse floating interest rate is also inconsistent with the description in paragraph 11.9A because the interest charged increases when reasonable compensation for the time value of money, credit risk or other basic lending risks and costs would decrease, and vice versa. The instrument is measured at fair value in accordance with Section 12.| 7|Interest on a GBP denominated mortgage is linked to the UK Land Registry House Price Index (HPI) plus 3% In accordance with paragraph 11.9(aA) the holderâ€™s return may be linked to an index of general price inflation of the currency of the debt instrument. The mortgage is denominated in GBP and a permitted inflation index would be an index that measures general price inflation of goods and services denominated in GBP. As the HPI measures inflation for residential properties in the UK and is not a measure of general price inflation, the return to the holder breaches the condition in paragraph 11.9(aA). The mortgage is also inconsistent with the description in paragraph 11.9A because the linkage to the HPI introduces exposure to a risk that is not consistent with a basic lending arrangement. The instrument is measured at fair value in accordance with Section 12.| 8|Early repayment of a loan is not permitted during an initial two-year period, but is thereafter
