to month 12 minus levy paid to month 11 = 0 Ð 0 = 0 Example 2 Ñ regular pay bill of £300,000 each month (£3.6 million for the tax year) Month 1 and each month of the tax year thereafter £300,000 + 0.5% = £1,500 levy Cumulative levy allowance = £1,250 Levy payable in month 1 = £1,500 Ð £1,250 = £250 Month 2 £600,000 (£300,000 + £300,000) + 0.5% = £3,000 Cumulative levy allowance £2,500 Levy payable to month 2 = £3,000 Ð £2,500 = £500 Levy paid in month 2 = levy payable to month 2 minus levy paid to month 1 = £500 Ð £250 = £250 And so on until month 12 £3.6 million (£300,000 + 12) + 0.5% = £18,000 Cumulative levy allowance £15,000 Levy payable to month 12 = £18,000 Ð £15,000 = £3,000 Levy paid in month 12 = levy payable to month 12 minus levy paid to month 11 = £3,000 Ð £2,750 = £250 This means that the organisation pays £250 each month in levy which totals £3,000 over the year. Example 3 Ñ seasonal pay bill Total pay bill is £3 million over the year but ßuctuates during it with a peak in June and July (month 3 and 4). Read the following table: Tax month Pay bill 1 £200,000 2 £200,000 3 £500,000 4 £500,000 5 £200,000 6 to 12 £200,000 To t a l £3 million Month 1 £200,000 + 0.5% = £1,000 levy Cumulative levy allowance = £1,250, for example Levy due up to month 1 is NIL as £1,000 levy is less than the cumulative allowance Month 2 £400,000 (£200,000 + £200,000) + 0.5% = £2,000 Cumulative levy allowance £2,500 Levy due up to month 2 is NIL as £2,000 levy = less than the cumulative allowance (£2,500) Levy paid in month 2 = levy due up to month 2 minus levy due up to month 1 = 0 Ð 0 = 0 Month 3 £900,000 (£200,000 + £200,000 + £500,000) + 0.5% = £4,500 Cumulative levy allowance £3,750 Levy due up to month 3 = £4,500 Ð £3,750 = £750 Levy paid in month 3 = levy due up to month 3 minus levy due up to month 2 = £750 Ð 0 = £750 Month 4 £1,400,000 (£200,000 + £200,000 + £500,000 + £500,000) + 0.5% = £7,000 Cumulative levy allowance £5,000 Levy due to month 4 = £7,000 Ð £5,000 = £2,000 Levy paid in month 4 = levy due up to month 4 minus levy due up to month 3 = £2,000 Ð £750 = £1,250 Month 5 Month 5 £1,600,000 (£200,000 + £200,000 + £500,000 + £500,000 + £200,000) + 0.5% = £8,000 Cumulative levy allowance £6,250 Levy due up to month 5 = £8,000 Ð £6,250 = £1,750 Levy paid in month 5 = levy due up to month 5 minus levy due up to month 4 = £1,750 Ð £2,000 = Ð £250 Therefore the employer gets a credit of £250 that month that may be used to o " set against other PAY E liabilities. Month 6 £1,800,000 (£200,000 + £200,000 + £500,000 + £500,000 + £200,000 + £200,000) + 0.5% = £9,000 Cumulative levy allowance £7,500 Levy due up to month 6 = £9,000 Ð £7,500 = £1,500 Levy paid in month 6 = levy due up to month 6 minus levy due up to month 5 = £1,500 Ð £1,750 = Ð £250 Therefore the organisation gets another credit in month 6 of £250 to set against their PAY E liabilities.
