Accountants 29 Lincoln�s Inn Fields London WC2A 3EE 15.8 Auditors� duties Subject to the Auditing Practices Board ethical standards, the auditors� statutory duties are limited to checking that there are adequate books and records, and to reporting on the annual accounts. Subject again to those ethical standards, there is nothing to stop a company employing an auditor for other purposes (such as keeping the books or compiling the tax return) if they do not take part in the management of the company. You should agree an engagement letter that sets out the scope of the auditor�s engagement and the form of any reports that the auditor will make. 15.9 Removal of auditors The members of a company may remove an auditor from o?ce at any time during their term of o?ce. They or the directors must give 28 days notice of their intention to put to a general meeting a resolution to remove the auditor. The company must send a copy of the notice to the auditor, who then has the right to make a written response and require that the company sends it to the company�s members, and to speak at the meeting where the resolution is to be considered. The company must register a form AA03 at Companies House within 14 days of the resolution being passed to remove the auditor. Although a company may remove an auditor from o?ce at any time, the auditor may be entitled to compensation or damages for termination of appointment. Alternatively, a company may decide not to reappoint the auditor for a further term. For a private company, the members can prevent the reappointment of an auditor by ordinary resolution. Members representing at least 5% of the company�s voting rights can also prevent the reappointment of an auditor by notifying the company.
