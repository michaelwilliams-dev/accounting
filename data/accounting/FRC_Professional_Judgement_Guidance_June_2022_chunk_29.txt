28 The engagement partner weighs the various alternative conclusions against how well they allow her to meet her objectives for the judgement. Having gathered and analysed a range of information, the engagement partner sees the judgement as coming down to two main considerations, reflecting the two ways she identified that the disclosure could be potentially misleading. Firstly, whether the intended users would understand from what is disclosed that the low level of net debt is likely transient and, secondly, whether the context that the net debt figure is shown in makes it appear as though the company’s capital management policy includes keeping net debt at broadly the year end level. This illustrative example does not contain sufficient detail for the engagement partner’s conclusion to be clear. Irrespective of how she concludes, the engagement partner will ensure that the issue is soundly documented on the audit file. Reflecting on the judgement, the engagement partner notes that issues have arisen during the judgement process that may trigger further professional judgement processes. These include the need to consider whether other parts of the financial statements could be materially misstated as a result of the unusual working capital policies prior to year end, and to assess how the company’s net debt and capital management policy are discussed in the front half of the annual report. Furthermore, if she ends up concluding that the disclosure is materially misstated, she will likely wish to consider the possibility that the original disclosure was intentionally deceptive, and the implications of that. This would raise issues around the integrity and values of F plc’s management, which could significantly alter the risk assessment for many areas of the audit, mandate greater professional scepticism and affect the decision as to whether to continue the audit engagement in future years.
