for rectifying the position. Nothing in this section affects a person's rights under section 1095 or 1096 (rectification of register on application to registrar or under court order). 128H Central register to be evidence The central register is prima facie evidence of any matters about which a company is required to deliver information to the registrar under this Chapter. Subsection (1) does not apply to information to be included in a statement under section 128B(5)(b) or in any updated statement under section 128B(6). 128I Time limits for claims arising from delivery to registrar Liability incurred by a company— from the delivery to the registrar of information under this Chapter, or from a failure to deliver any such information, is not enforceable more than 10 years after the date on which the information was delivered or, as the case may be, the failure first occurred. This is without prejudice to any lesser period of limitation (and, in Scotland, to any rule that the obligation giving rise to the liability prescribes before the expiry of that period). 128J Withdrawing the election A company may withdraw an election made by or in respect of it under section 128B. Withdrawal is achieved by giving notice of withdrawal to the registrar. The withdrawal takes effect when the notice is registered by the registrar. The effect of withdrawal is that the company's obligation under Chapter 2 to maintain a register of members applies from then on with respect to the period going forward. This means that, when the withdrawal takes effect— the company must enter in its register of members all the information that is required to be contained in that register in respect of matters that are current as at that time, Part 8 – A company's members Chapter 3 – Overseas branch registers Document
