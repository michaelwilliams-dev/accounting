it does not need to be certain, or even likely, that the micro-entity will be required to transfer an economic resource â€“ the transfer may, for example, be required only if a specified uncertain future event occurs. It is only necessary that the obligation already exists and that, in at least one circumstance, it would require the micro-entity to transfer an economic resource. Obligations to transfer an economic resource include, for example: obligations to pay cash; obligations to deliver goods or provide services; obligations to exchange economic resources with another party on unfavourable terms; obligations to transfer an economic resource if a specified uncertain future event occurs; and obligations to issue a financial instrument if that financial instrument will oblige the micro-entity to transfer an economic resource. Instead of fulfilling an obligation to transfer an economic resource to the party that has a right to receive that resource, micro-entities sometimes decide to, for example: settle the obligation by negotiating a release from the obligation; transfer the obligation to a third party; or replace that obligation to transfer an economic resource with another obligation by entering into a new transaction. To satisfy the criterion in paragraph 2.14(c), a present obligation exists as a result of past events only if: the micro-entity has already obtained economic benefits or taken an action; and as a consequence, the micro-entity will or may have to transfer an economic resource that it would not otherwise have had to transfer. The economic benefits obtained could include, for example, goods or services. The action taken could include, for example, operating a particular business or operating in a particular market. If economic benefits are obtained, or an action is taken, over time, the resulting present obligation may accumulate over that time. Income and expenses Users of financial statements need
