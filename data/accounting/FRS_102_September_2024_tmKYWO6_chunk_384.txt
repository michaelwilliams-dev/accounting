plan. 28.11A Where an entity participates in a defined benefit plan, which is a multi-employer plan that in accordance with paragraph 28.11 is accounted for as if the plan were a defined contribution plan, and the entity has entered into an agreement with the multi-employer plan that determines how the entity will fund a deficit, the entity shall recognise a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to the deficit) and the resulting expense in profit or loss in accordance with paragraphs 28.13 and 28.13A. 28.11B When an entity participates in a defined benefit plan, which is a multi-employer plan that in accordance with paragraph 28.11 is accounted for as if the plan were a defined contribution plan, and sufficient information to use defined benefit accounting becomes available, the entity shall: apply defined benefit accounting in accordance with paragraphs 28.14 to 28.28 from the relevant date as defined in paragraph 28.11C; and recognise the difference between: its net defined benefit liability (after taking into account the effect of paragraph 28.22, if any) at the relevant date as defined in paragraph 28.11C; and the carrying value at the relevant date of its liability for the contributions payable arising from an agreement to fund a deficit, if any, plus any liability recognised in accordance with paragraph 28.13(a); as a separate item in other comprehensive income. 28.11C For the purposes of applying paragraph 28.11B, the relevant date is the later of the first day for which sufficient information to use defined benefit accounting becomes available, and the first day of the current reporting period (comparative information is not restated). D For the avoidance of doubt, the difference calculated in accordance with paragraph 28.11B(b) excludes the impact of any plan changes, curtailments or settlements occurring
