income from a legacy should be recognised when it is probable that the legacy will be received and its value can be measured reliably. As this principle was unchanged, the amendments were not expected to alter existing practice. Public Benefit Entity Combinations B34J.1 In considering the issue of entity combinations involving two or more public benefit entities, it was noted that there is some debate over whether the use of acquisition accounting for all combinations would be appropriate. In particular, whether acquisition accounting reflects the substance of a transaction if there is a gift of one entity to another in a combination at nil or nominal consideration, or where two or more organisations genuinely merge to form a new entity. B34J.2 When there is a combination of entities at nil or nominal consideration which is in substance a gift, it is appropriate to follow the same accounting principles as donations of assets (as set out in Section 34 Specialised Activities) by recognising the fair value of the assets received and liabilities assumed as a gain or loss in income and expenditure. B34J.3 Accounting for combinations that meet the definition of a merger requires a different methodology to acquisition accounting in order to reflect the true substance of the transaction. Whilst it is not anticipated that all combinations involving two or more public benefit entities are mergers or that merger accounting will generally be applicable to such combinations, it is considered appropriate to retain merger accounting in certain circumstances. In considering this matter it was noted that the accounting requirements for PBEs in some jurisdictions, for example, the US and Australia, had retained merger accounting for the public and not-for-profit sectors. B34J.4 The criteria set out in FRS 6 Acquisitions and Mergers have been adapted to make them more appropriate for
