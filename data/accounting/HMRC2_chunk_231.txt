from the amount left. You�ll be left with the net amount you need to pay the subcontractor. Paying subcontractors You usually pay your subcontractors directly. But you can pay them through a third party (such as a relative or debt company) if they ask you to. If you make deductions, you must give the subcontractor a payment and deduction statement within 14 days of the end of each tax month. Example If the tax month was 6 May to 5 June, you must give the statement by 19 June. If you�re not making payments If you know you�re not going to make any payments to subcontractors for up to 6 months, you can ask for your scheme to be made �inactive�. HMRC will not send you any returns for that period. You must file a return when you start paying subcontractors again.
