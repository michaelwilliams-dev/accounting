is an investment property. Entity C has an accounting policy to revalue its properties and to fully depreciate them over a useful life of 50 years from the date of purchase. Property A was acquired on 31 December 1984 at a cost of CU1,000 and has been revalued on a regular basis; the last time was on 31 December 2014 when its value was recorded in the financial statements at CU100,000 and its remaining useful life was 20 years. There has been no significant change in the value of Property A since that revaluation. Property B was acquired on 31 December 2014, at a cost of CU50,000. Property B has never been revalued as it was purchased in the same year that the most recent valuation was carried out and at that time its cost was the best available evidence of its valuation. There has been no impairment in its value. On transition: Entity C decides not to continue its policy of revaluation.

If the revalued amount of CU100,000 were used as its deemed cost, in order to comply with company law the difference from the relevant historical cost amount would need to be shown in a revaluation reserve and the excess depreciation, above that calculated on a historical cost basis, would continue to be offset against it. Also as Property A is not
