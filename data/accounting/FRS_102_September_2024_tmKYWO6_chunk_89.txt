information provided by a measurement basis is affected by: the characteristics of the asset or liability, in particular the variability of cash flows and whether the value of the asset or liability is sensitive to market factors or other risks; and how that asset or liability contributes to future cash flows. If the value of an asset or liability is sensitive to market factors or other risks, its historical cost might differ significantly from its current value. Consequently, historical cost may not provide relevant information if information about changes in value is important to users of financial statements. For assets and liabilities that produce cash flows directly, such as assets that can be sold independently and without a significant economic penalty, the measurement basis that provides the most relevant information is likely to be a current value that incorporates current estimates of the amount, timing and uncertainty of the future cash flows. For assets and liabilities that do not produce cash flows directly, the principles of relevance and faithful representation should be considered to the extent that they apply to the facts and circumstances. Faithful representation In some circumstances, avoiding an accounting mismatch by using the same measurement basis for related assets and liabilities may provide users of financial statements with information that is more useful than the information that would result from using different measurement bases. This may be particularly likely when the cash flows from one asset or liability are directly linked to the cash flows from another asset or liability. When a measure cannot be determined directly by observing prices in an active market and must instead be estimated, measurement uncertainty arises. The level of measurement uncertainty associated with a particular measurement basis may affect whether information provided by that measurement basis provides a faithful representation of
