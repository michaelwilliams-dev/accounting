recognised in the statement of financial position. Similarly, only items that meet the definition of income or expenses are recognised in profit or loss. However, not all items that meet the definition of one of those elements are recognised, for example if doing so would not provide relevant information, or if the costs of doing so outweigh the benefits. The recognition criteria for an item that meets the definition of one of the elements of financial statements are set out in the applicable sections of this FRS. The failure to recognise an item that satisfies the recognition criteria is not rectified by disclosure of the accounting policies used or by notes or explanatory material. Unless explicitly required or permitted by this FRS, a micro-entity shall not recognise items in the statement of financial position that do not meet the definition of assets or of liabilities regardless of whether they result from applying the notion commonly referred to as ‘matching’ for measuring profit or loss. An item that fails to meet the recognition criteria may qualify for recognition at a later date as a result of subsequent circumstances or events. Derecognition Derecognition normally occurs when an item no longer meets the definition of an asset or of a liability: for an asset, derecognition normally occurs when the micro-entity loses control of all or part of the recognised asset; and for a liability, derecognition normally occurs when the micro-entity no longer has a present obligation for all or part of the recognised liability. Accounting requirements for derecognition aim to faithfully represent both any assets and liabilities retained after the transaction or other event that led to derecognition and the change in assets or liabilities as a result of that transaction or other event. The aim of paragraph 2.33 is normally achieved by:
