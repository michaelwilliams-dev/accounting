to comment We welcome written submissions on any of the matters set out in this document by 6 February 2025. We particularly welcome responses to the questions/issues below. Do you agree with our emerging findings? Please explain. Do you have any views or suggestions on any actions that should be taken in light of our emerging findings, including any actions that could be implemented quickly? In the first part of the market study, we identified increases in NHS audit fees in recent years. We heard from some stakeholders that fee increases may be driven by changes to audit standards and regulations including in relation to whether the audit is an MLA. We intend to explore this issue further and welcome any further views and information including on the threshold for MLA status, and information that highlights any risks and unintended consequences of the current thresholds for designating MLAs? In the first part of the market study, we heard that a barrier to entry and expansion could be a lack of experience in NHS/local government audit. Do you think auditors with experience in auditing other sectors could deliver good quality NHS audits if there was no requirement for KAP accreditation? Should audit firms have more discretion on the staff responsible for NHS audits? In the first part of the market study, we did not explore in detail the role and effectiveness of NHS Audit Committees and Audit Committee Chairs in relation to the appointment and oversight of the external auditor. We welcome any views and information on this issue. In the first part of the market study, we received mixed comments on the usefulness of the VFM reporting element of NHS audits. We welcome any further information on this issue and any views on changes, if any, that should be made
