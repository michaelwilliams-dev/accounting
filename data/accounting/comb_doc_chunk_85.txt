relation to fair value measurement of investment property and introduce the accounting policy option for investment property rented to another group entity. As a result, the only time when investment property within the scope of Section 16 is not measured at fair value will be if a reliable measure of fair value is not available, which is expected to be rare. Recognising changes in fair value in profit or loss is an application of the fair value accounting requirements of Schedule 1 to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/410) (the Regulations), specifically paragraph 40. Example Entity A has an investment property. The property is measured at fair value at each reporting date. Its fair value at 31 December 2017 was CU300,000 and its fair value at 31 December 2018 was CU320,000. The change in fair value is recognised as follows: Dr Investment property CU20,000 Cr Profit and loss account CU20,000 Entity A will also need to account for any deferred tax implications arising from the change in fair value. Recognising the change in fair value in profit or loss does not make those gains immediately chargeable to corporation tax, which will typically arise on disposal of the investment property. Presentation in reserves As fair value accounting requirements apply, the change in fair value has been recognised in profit or loss, it is not recognised in a revaluation reserve. However, an entity may choose to transfer a portion of its retained profit and loss account equal to the cumulative fair value gains for presentation purposes to a separate reserve, as this element of the profit and loss account is not realised, and not available for distribution.
