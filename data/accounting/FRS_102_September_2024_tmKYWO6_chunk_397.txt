unless the possibility of an outflow in settlement is remote. Section 29 Income Tax Scope of this section [Deleted] This section applies to: income tax comprising: current tax; and deferred tax including deferred tax in respect of assets (other than goodwill) and liabilities recognised as a result of a business combination; and value added tax (VAT) and other similar sales taxes, which are not income taxes. 29.2A [Moved to paragraph 29.2(b)] B As an exception to the requirements in this section, an entity shall neither recognise nor disclose information about deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities related to Pillar Two income tax. Recognition and measurement of current tax An entity shall recognise a current tax liability for tax payable on taxable profit for the current and past periods. If the amount of tax paid for the current and past periods exceeds the amount of tax payable for those periods, the entity shall recognise the excess as a current tax asset. An entity shall recognise a current tax asset for the benefit of a tax loss that can be carried back to recover tax paid in a previous period. An entity shall measure a current tax liability (asset) at the amount of tax it expects to pay (recover) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Recognition of deferred tax Timing differences Deferred tax shall be recognised in respect of all timing differences at the reporting date, except as otherwise required by paragraphs 29.7 to 29.9 and 29.11A below. Timing differences are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in financial statements.
