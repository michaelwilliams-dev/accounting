entities shall, in their individual accounts, recognise a cost equal to their contribution payable for the period. (FRS 102 paragraph 28.38)| FRS 102 does not permit the pension liability or asset to only be recognised in the consolidated financial statements, as permitted by FRS 17. Under FRS 102 at least one entity will apply defined benefit accounting depending on the policy for charging pension costs around the group. This may have an impact on distributable reserves1. 1 See ICAEW Technical Release Tech 02/10 Guidance on the Determination of Realised Profits and Losses in the Context of Distributions under the Companies Act 2006 available on the ICAEW website (www.icaew.com). Disclosures FRS 17|FRS 102| Requires specific disclosures to be provided for multi-employer schemes where an employer is affected by a surplus or deficit in the scheme, but is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. This may apply to individual entities participating in a group pension scheme. In these circumstances the general disclosure requirements of FRS 17 do not apply. (FRS 17 paragraph 9(b))|Where an entity accounts for an allocation of the plan’s cost then it makes all the disclosures required by paragraph 28.41. (FRS 102 paragraph 28.41) If the entity accounts for the plan on a contribution basis then the disclosures are restricted to: a general description of the plan; date of the most recent actuarial valuation; details of the plan assets; and details of the own equity instruments or properties occupied by the entity included in the plan assets. This information can, however, be disclosed by cross referring to another group entity’s financial statements if certain criteria are met. (FRS 102 paragraph 28.41A)| There are differences in the disclosure requirements for entities participating in group defined benefit
