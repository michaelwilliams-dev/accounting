that give a true and fair view, whereas micro-entity accounts are automatically presumed in law to give a true and fair view if the legal minimum disclosure requirements are adhered to. Section 1A of FRS 102 sets out the disclosure requirements that are required by company law and provides additional requirements and guidance to assist directors of small entities. For the UK, Section 1A specifies additional disclosures which the FRC considers are required, subject to materiality considerations, in order to give a true and fair view. For the Republic of Ireland, Section 1A specifies additional disclosures which the FRC encourages a small entity to make because they may be necessary in order to give a true and fair view. In both jurisdictions, directors of small entities will have to apply judgement to establish if any further disclosures are required to ensure the accounts give a true and fair view. Appendix II to this document sets out the key features of Section 1A of FRS 102. Additional options for entities that are part of a group For entities that are part of a group and included in the consolidated financial statements (known as qualifying entities), the UK and Ireland GAAP framework provides two additional reporting regimes. Both regimes aim to make group reporting more efficient and cost-effective by permitting consistent accounting policies to be applied across a group, but with reduced disclosures.
