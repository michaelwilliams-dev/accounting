STAFF GUIDANCE NOTE 03/2016 Period of Engagement The Audit Regulation requires the auditor’s report for a public interest entity (PIE) to disclose the date of appointment of the auditor, and the period of total uninterrupted engagement, including previous renewals and reappointments of the auditor.
