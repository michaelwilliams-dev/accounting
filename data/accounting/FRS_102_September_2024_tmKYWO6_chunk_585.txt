IAS 39 and/or IFRS 9, or has an existing accounting policy of insurance contract accounting for financial guarantee contracts and chooses to continue to apply that policy under FRS 103 Insurance Contracts. Use of the term ‘derivatives’ B11.7 As part of the Triennial Review 2017, a number of minor changes were made to Sections 11 and 12 arising from comments received from stakeholders, including a more direct reference to ‘derivatives’ in the relevant paragraphs. Previously, these sections avoided the word creating ambiguity for stakeholders. Given that it is already defined in FRS 102, this change improved the drafting. One consequence of this is a change to the definition of a financial liability, but this is not expected to have any practical effects. Classification of financial instruments B11.8 In July 2014, amendments to Section 11 were made to address concerns raised in relation to the classification of financial instruments. After the publication of FRS 102, feedback from stakeholders indicated that the implementation of the accounting requirements of FRS 102 for loans with common contractual features could have unintended consequences for many entities because the conditions for classification as basic were overly restrictive.
