for recognising assets, liabilities, income, and expenses for interim periods are the same as in annual financial statements. To illustrate: The principles for recognising and measuring losses from inventory write-downs, restructurings, or impairments in an interim period are the same as those that an entity would follow if it prepared only annual financial statements. However, if such items are recognised and measured in one interim period and the estimate changes in a subsequent interim period of that financial year, the original estimate is changed in the subsequent interim period either by accrual of an additional amount of loss or by reversal of the previously recognised amount, unless the reversal of a previously recognised impairment is prohibited by FRS 102. A cost that does not meet the definition of an asset at the end of an interim period is not deferred in the statement of financial position either to await future information as to whether it has met the definition of an asset or to smooth earnings over interim periods within a financial year. Income tax expense is recognised in each interim period based on the best estimate of the weighted average annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year, using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of an interim reporting period. Amounts accrued for income tax expense in one interim period may have to be adjusted in a subsequent interim period of that financial year if the estimate of the annual income tax rate changes. Under Section 2 Concepts and Pervasive Principles of FRS 102, recognition is the process of incorporating in the statement of financial position or statement(s) of comprehensive income an item that meets the definition of one of the elements of the financial statements.
