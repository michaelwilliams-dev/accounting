As a result, in May 2017 the FRC made an interim amendment to FRS 102 to allow immediate relief for small entities pending a permanent solution. This was included in paragraph 1.15A, which has now been deleted. B11.37 Respondents agreed with the proposals, but a number of respondents suggested that the exemption should apply to additional transactions, such an intra-group transactions and loans from all directors or all shareholders.

Some small businesses are operated and financed by a group of family members, who may have varying interests in the business.
