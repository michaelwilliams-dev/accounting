by members of the Investment Association (IA), who ranked culture as the 7th most important and the 8th most frequent issue for engagement in their stewardship activities survey. When it comes to culture benchmarks, respondents agreed that peer-to-peer comparisons, although useful, cannot be fully relied on. Answers suggested a certain amount of hesitancy towards assuming that because businesses look similar, culture would be easy to compare. In terms of remuneration and incentive structures, half of respondents agreed that executive remuneration and incentive structures should include cultural indicators, both at an investee company and investor side. However, respondents voiced their concerns over the principle versus the reality of the application as culture is seen as a difficult indicator to quantify, meaning it would be hard to assess the challenging nature of targets. Culture reporting To see if investors are reporting on their stewardship of culture and their firm’s own culture, we have analysed a random small sample of stewardship reports from those firms that published their reports prior to any decisions made by the FRC on successful signatories to the UK Stewardship Code. Our findings showed that disclosure in this area varied widely across the sample. The most talked about was day-to-day working culture, with just over a half of reports discussing their firms’ strong working practices, staff diversity, and training and development they had fostered. However, none of those firms explicitly mentioned culture as a reason for external engagement. The remaining number of reports talked about the impact of the investee company’s culture on informing an assessment of a company and their leadership. Several investors used case studies on engagement on culture during COVID-19 as an example of adherence to Principle 4 of the Stewardship Code, discussing how culture and governance had been used to respond to market-wide risks.
