which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund) and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions or to make direct benefit payments to employees if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Thus, the amount of the post-employment benefits received by the employee is determined by the amount of contributions paid by an entity (and perhaps also the employee) to a post-employment benefit plan or to an insurer, together with investment returns arising from the contributions. Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under defined benefit plans, the entity’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by the entity. If actuarial or investment experience is worse than expected, the entity’s obligation may be increased, and vice versa if actuarial or investment experience is better than expected. Multi-employer plans and state plans Multi-employer plans and state plans are classified as defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans on the basis of the terms of the plan, including any constructive obligation that goes beyond the formal terms. However, if sufficient information is not available to use defined benefit accounting for a multi-employer plan that is a defined benefit plan, an entity shall account for the plan in accordance with paragraphs 28.13 and 28.13A as if it was a defined contribution plan and make the disclosures required by paragraphs 28.40 and 28.40A. An entity shall account for a state plan in the same way as for a multi-employer
