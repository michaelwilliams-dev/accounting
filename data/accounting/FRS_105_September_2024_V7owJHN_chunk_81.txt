at the time of sale to purchasers of its product. Under the terms of the contract for sale, the manufacturer undertakes to make good, by repair or replacement, manufacturing defects that become apparent within three years from the date of sale. On the basis of experience, it is probable (ie more likely than not) that there will be some claims under the warranties. Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event: The obligating event is the sale of the product with a warranty, which gives rise to a legal obligation. An outflow of resources embodying economic benefits in settlement: Probable for the warranties as a whole. Conclusion: The micro-entity recognises a provision for the best estimate of the costs of making good under the warranty products sold before the reporting date. Illustration of calculations: In 20X0, goods are sold for CU100,000. Experience indicates that 90% of products sold require no warranty repairs; 6% of products sold require minor repairs costing 30% of the sale price; and 4% of products sold require major repairs or replacement costing 70% of sale price. Therefore estimated warranty costs are: CU100,000 × 90% × 0 =|CU0| CU100,000 × 6% × 30% =|CU1,800| CU100,000 × 4% × 70% =|CU2,800| Total|CU4,600| The expenditures for warranty repairs and replacements for products sold in 20X0 are expected to be made 60% in 20X1, 30% in 20X2, and 10% in 20X3, in each case at the end of the period. Because the estimated cash flows already reflect the probabilities of the cash outflows, and assuming there are no other risks or uncertainties that must be reflected, to determine the present value of those cash flows the micro-entity uses a ‘risk-free’ discount rate based on national government bonds with the same term as the expected cash outflows (6% for
