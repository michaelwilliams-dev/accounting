Entities reflected the requirements of the EU Accounting Directive which preclude Member States from imposing specific disclosure requirements on small entities besides the limited disclosures set out in company law. As a result, small entities were required to apply significant judgement in determining which additional disclosures needed to be provided in order to give a true and fair view. Those requirements of the EU Accounting Directive had not been written into UK company law, but had acted as a constraint in developing Section 1A. As a result, following the UK’s exit from the European Union, the FRC identified an opportunity to specify, for UK small entities, additional disclosures which are expected to be required in order to give a true and fair view, thereby reducing the amount of judgement required of preparers. In practice, as the requirement to give a true and fair view is unchanged, it is expected that the disclosures provided by UK small entities may not change, but that the process of deciding which disclosures to provide should be simplified. The legal position for Irish small entities is unchanged. Section 1A cannot, and does not, require specific disclosures of Irish small entities besides those set out in Irish company law.
