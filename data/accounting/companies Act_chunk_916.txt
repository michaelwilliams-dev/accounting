of incorporation, and in the case of a registrable person, that particular is deemed to have been “confirmed”. For the purposes of this section— if a person's usual residential address is the same as his or her service address, the entry for him or her in the register may state that fact instead of repeating the address (but this does not apply in a case where the service address is stated to be “The company's registered office”); nothing in section 126 (trusts not to be entered on register) affects what may be entered in a company's PSC register or is receivable by the registrar in relation to people with significant control over a company (even if they are members of the company); see section 790J (exemptions) for cases where a person does not count as a registrable person or a registrable relevant legal entity. If a company makes default in complying with this section, an offence is committed by— the company, and every officer of the company who is in default. A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale and, for continued contravention, a daily default fine not exceeding one-tenth of level 3 on the standard scale. A company to which this Part applies is not by virtue of anything done for the purposes of this section affected with notice of, or put upon inquiry as to, the rights of any person in relation to any shares or rights in or with respect to the company.
