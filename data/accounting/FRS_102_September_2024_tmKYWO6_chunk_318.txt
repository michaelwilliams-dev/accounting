will amortise the bond discount according to the following table: |(a) Interest payment|(b) Total interest expense = 6% × (e)|(c) Amortisation of bond discount = (b) – (a)|(d) Bond discount = (d) – (c)|(e) Net liability = 50,000 – (d)| |CU|CU|CU|CU|CU| 01/01/20X5||||4,212|45,788| 31/12/20X5|2,000|2,747|747|3,465|46,535| 31/12/20X6|2,000|2,792|792|2,673|47,327| 31/12/20X7|2,000|2,840|840|1,833|48,167| 31/12/20X8|2,000|2,890|890|943|49,057| 31/12/20X9|2,000|2,943|943|0|50,000| Totals|10,000|14,212|4,212||| At the end of 20X5, the issuer would make the following journal entry: Dr Interest expense|CU2,747| Cr Bond discount|CU747| Cr Cash|CU2,000| Calculations Present value of principal of CU50,000 at 6% CU50,000 (1.06)5 = 37,363 Present value of the interest annuity of CU2,000 (= CU50,000 × 4%) payable at the end of each of five years The CU2,000 annual interest payments are an annuity: a cash flow stream with a limited number (n) of periodic payments (C), receivable at dates 1 to n. To calculate the present value of this annuity, future payments are discounted by the periodic rate of interest (i) using the following formula: C 1 PV = i × �1 − (1+i)n� Therefore, the present value of the CU2,000 interest payments is: 2,000 1 PV = 0.06 × �1 − (1.06)5� = 8,425 This is equivalent to the sum of the present values of the five individual CU2,000 payments, as follows: |CU| Present value of interest payment at 31 December 20X5 = 2,000/1.06|1,887| Present value of interest payment at 31 December 20X6 = 2,000/1.062|1,780| Present value of interest payment at 31 December 20X7 = 2,000/1.063|1,679| Present value of interest payment at 31 December 20X8 = 2,000/1.064|1,584| Present value of interest payment at 31 December 20X9 = 2,000/1.065|1,495| Total|8,425| Yet another way to calculate this is to use a table of present value of an ordinary annuity in arrears, five periods, interest rate of 6% per period. (Such tables are easily found on the Internet.) The present value factor is 4.2124.
