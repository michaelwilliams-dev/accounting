value in use) may not be appropriate. In these circumstances value in use (in respect of assets held for their service potential) is determined by the present value of the assetâ€™s remaining service potential plus the net amount the entity will receive from its disposal. In some cases this may be taken to be costs avoided by possession of the asset. Therefore, depreciated replacement cost, may be a suitable measurement model but other approaches may be used where more appropriate. Recognising and measuring an impairment loss for a cash-generating unit An impairment loss shall be recognised for a cash-generating unit if, and only if, the recoverable amount of the unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit. The impairment loss shall be allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the assets of the unit in the following order: first, to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit; and then, to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the cash-generating unit. However, an entity shall not reduce the carrying amount of any asset in the cash-generating unit below the highest of: its fair value less costs to sell (if determinable); its value in use (if determinable); and zero. Any excess amount of the impairment loss that cannot be allocated to an asset because of the restriction in paragraph 27.22 shall be allocated to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of those other assets. Additional requirements for impairment of goodwill Goodwill, by itself, cannot be sold. Nor does it generate cash flows to an entity that are independent of the cash flows of other assets. As a consequence, the recoverable amount of goodwill cannot
