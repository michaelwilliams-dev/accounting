selling price at contract inception of the distinct good or service underlying each performance obligation in the contract and allocate the transaction price in proportion to those stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling price is the price at which a micro-entity would sell a good or service promised in a contract separately to a customer. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the observable price of a good or service when the micro-entity sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, a micro-entity shall estimate it. When estimating a stand-alone selling price, a micro-entity shall take into account all information that is reasonably available to the micro-entity, including market conditions, entity-specific factors and information about the customer or class of customer. A micro-entity shall apply estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances. Suitable estimation methods include referring to prices from the micro-entityâ€™s competitors for similar goods or services, or the expected costs of transferring the good or service promised to a customer plus an appropriate margin. Allocation of a discount or variable consideration A customer receives a discount if the sum of the stand-alone selling prices of the goods or services promised in the contract exceeds the promised consideration. A discount or amount of variable consideration (see paragraphs 18.22 to 18.24) may be attributable to the entire contract or to a specific part of the contract. A micro-entity shall allocate a discount or amount of variable consideration to all the performance obligations in the contract on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, unless this basis does not depict the amount of consideration to which the micro-entity expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation in the contract. In that case, the micro-entity
