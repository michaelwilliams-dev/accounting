audit market In our approach to competition, we are also mindful that it may take time to realise significant change in the UK audit market, especially in respect of the FTSE 350 audit market. Large audit firms operate internationally, and their focus will vary in line with wider developments. For example, some audit firms may now be increasingly focused on growing their business to provide more assurance on sustainability reporting. Audit firms’ global networks are an important feature of the audit market. In 2019, the CMA concluded that the FTSE 350 audit market ‘exhibits a number of deep- seated problems: audit committees are only a partial solution to the problem that companies select their own auditors; high concentration among four big audit firms, resulting in limited choice and a market that is not resilient; audits being carried out by firms whose main business is not in audit.’5 The CMA found there were no simple answers to these problems. While the CMA concluded there should be five, six or even seven firms auditing the largest companies in the UK, it found the existing FTSE 350 audit market structure is heavily entrenched, so this will not be easy to achieve, and it would take time – perhaps some considerable time – to realise a well-functioning audit market. 5 CMA statutory audit market study summary final report, April 2019, p.2 Recent developments with competition in the audit market Our approach and work on competition is informed by what is happening in the audit market, especially in the FTSE 350 and wider PIE audit markets.
