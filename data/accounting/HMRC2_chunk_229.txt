still deduct the full amount of capital allowances (�1,800) from your balance - even though you can only claim half of them (�900) on your tax return. The closing balance in this pool is �8,200 (�10,000 minus �1,800). This is the starting balance for the next year. Items you use privately that are not in a single asset pool If you start using something outside your business that you�ve already claimed capital allowances on: add the market value of the item (the amount you�d expect to sell it for) to a single asset pool deduct the same amount from the pool it was in If the amount you deduct is more than the balance in the pool, the di?erence is a �balancing charge� - you must put it on your tax return. Claiming less than you�re entitled to You do not have to claim the full amount you�re entitled to. If you only claim part, the rest stays in your closing balance. If you have �1,000 or less in your pool You can claim the full amount if the balance in your main or special rate pool is �1,000 or less before you work out your allowance. This is called a small pools allowance. It does not apply to single asset pools. You can either claim a small pools allowance or writing down allowances - you cannot claim both. This amount is adjusted if your accounting period is more or less than 12 months. For example, if your accounting period is 9 months the limit will be 9/12 x �1,000 = �750.
