‘Companies Act 2006’ (‘the Act’), ‘The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/410)’ (‘the Regulations’), and ‘The Companies, Partnerships and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2015 (SI 2015/980)’. In an Irish context reference should be made to the relevant sections and paragraphs of Irish company law. Such general references are not dealt with in the tables below. References in the text to ‘IAS accounts’ are to be read as ‘IFRS financial statements’ in Irish company law. IFRS financial statements are within the scope of the IAS Regulation. For the purposes of the tables below, where general references are made in the text of this FRS to Schedules to the Regulations, the approach taken is that the corresponding Schedule to the Companies Act 2014 is referenced. For example, the corresponding reference used for Schedule 1 to the Regulations is Schedule 3 to the Companies Act 2014 (Accounting principles, form and content of entity financial statements). Likewise, the corresponding Irish references used for Schedule 2 and for Schedule 3 to the Regulations are the following, respectively: the European Union (Credit Institutions: Financial Statements) Regulations 2015 (SI No. 266 of 2015) (Credit Institutions Regulations 2015); and the European Union (Insurance Undertakings: Financial Statements) Regulations 2015 (SI No. 262 of 2015) (Insurance Undertakings Regulations 2015). Similar to the approach noted in paragraph A2.2 of Appendix II of this FRS, where reference is made in this appendix to Schedule 3 to the Companies Act 2014, Irish entities applying the Credit Institutions Regulations 2015 or the Insurance Undertakings Regulations 2015 should read the references as referring to the corresponding paragraphs in those regulations where applicable. The requirements of Schedule 3 to the Companies Act 2014 are not necessarily the same as those contained in the Credit Institutions Regulations 2015 or
