the date of initial recognition. Certain financial instruments, such as equity investments, are subject to different requirements that are not covered in this factsheet. Examples Section 11 includes an example of determining an effective interest rate and the amortised cost for a five-year loan. This follows paragraph 11.20. Impairment At the end of each reporting period an entity is required to assess whether there is objective evidence of impairment of any financial assets measured at cost or amortised cost. If there is objective evidence of impairment, an impairment loss shall be recognised immediately in profit or loss. Losses should be the result of past events, not losses expected as a result of possible future events. In the absence of any objective evidence or observable data indicating that a loss has occurred, there is no basis for recognising an impairment, or bad debt provision. Some financial assets must be assessed individually for impairment (all equity instruments and other financial assets that are individually significant). Others can be assessed individually or grouped based on similar credit risk characteristics. Examples Examples of objective evidence of impairment are included in paragraphs 11.22 and 11.23 of FRS 102. Key FRS 102 references 11.14 to 11.20 11.20 to 11.26 and Derecognition The derecognition requirements of paragraphs 11.33 to 11.38 of FRS 102 apply to all financial instruments, and are not dependent on their classification as basic or other. Derecognition of a financial liability A financial liability is derecognised only when it is extinguished (ie when it is discharged, cancelled or expires). If an existing borrower and lender exchange financial instruments with substantially different terms, or substantially modify the terms of an existing financial liability, they shall be accounted for as an extinguishment of the original liability, and the recognition of any new liability.
