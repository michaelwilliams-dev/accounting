estimated reliably when all the following conditions are met: the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably; and the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably. (FRS 102 paragraph 23.14)| There does not appear to be any significant difference between FRS 102 and SSAP 9 regarding the point at which profit may first be recognised on a long-term contract for the rendering of services. The SSAP 9 requirement for the outcome to be reasonably certain is normally equal to a reliable estimate. Amount of revenue recognised on service contracts SSAP 9, UITF Abstract 40|FRS 102| Where the outcome of a contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty, the prudently calculated attributable profit should be recognised as the difference between turnover (ascertained in a manner appropriate to the stage of completion of the contract, the business and the industry in which it operates) and the related costs. (SSAP 9 paragraphs 8 and 9)|When the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services can be estimated reliably, revenue is calculated by reference to the stage (or percentage) of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period. Further guidance is provided on applying the method. (FRS 102 paragraph 23.14)| Where the substance of a contract is that a right to consideration does not arise until the occurrence of a critical event, revenue is not recognised until that event occurs. This only applies where the right to consideration is conditional or contingent on a specified future event or outcome, the occurrence of which is outside the control
