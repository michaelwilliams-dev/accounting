a discount rate specified in paragraph 28.17. The unwinding of the discount shall be recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss in the period in which it arises. Post-employment benefits: Defined benefit plans Recognition In applying the general recognition principle in paragraph 28.3 to defined benefit plans, an entity shall recognise: a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of plan assets – its ‘net defined benefit liability’ (see paragraphs 28.15 to 28.22); and the net change in that liability during the period as the cost of its defined benefit plans during the period (see paragraphs 28.23 to 28.27). Measurement of the net defined benefit liability An entity shall measure the net defined benefit liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans at the net total of the following amounts: the present value of its obligations under defined benefit plans (its defined benefit obligation) at the reporting date (paragraphs 28.16 to 28.21A provide guidance for measuring this obligation); minus the fair value at the reporting date of plan assets (if any) out of which the obligations are to be settled. Section 2A Fair Value Measurement provides guidance on determining the fair values of those plan assets, except that, if the asset is an insurance policy that exactly matches the amount and timing of some or all of the benefits payable under the plan, the fair value of the asset is deemed to be the present value of the related obligation. A Where an entity has measured its defined benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method (including the use of appropriate actuarial assumptions), as set out in paragraph 28.18, it shall not recognise any additional liabilities to reflect differences between these assumptions and those used for the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan for funding
