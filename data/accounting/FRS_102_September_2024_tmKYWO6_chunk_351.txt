consideration is due. For example, an entity would recognise a trade receivable if it has a present right to payment even though that amount may be subject to refund in the future. Alternative descriptions of ‘contract liability’, ‘contract asset’ and ‘trade receivable’ may be used in the statement of financial position or in the notes. An entity that chooses to do so shall provide sufficient information for users of its financial statements to distinguish between trade receivables and contract assets. Customers’ unexercised rights When an entity receives an upfront non-refundable payment that gives the customer a right to receive a good or service in the future (eg a gift card), this gives rise to a contract liability. However, customers might not exercise all of their contractual rights. Those unexercised rights are often referred to as breakage. To determine whether it expects to be entitled to a breakage amount in a contract liability, an entity shall consider the requirements in paragraph 23.46 on constraining estimates of variable consideration. If an entity expects to be entitled to a breakage amount in a contract liability, the entity shall recognise the expected breakage amount as revenue in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer. If an entity does not expect to be entitled to a breakage amount, the entity shall recognise the expected breakage amount as revenue when the likelihood of the customer exercising its remaining rights becomes remote. Disclosures An entity shall disaggregate revenue recognised from contracts with customers into categories that depict how its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Categories that might be appropriate include: type of good or service (eg major product lines); geographical market (eg country or region); market or type of customer (eg government and non-government customers); timing of transfer of goods
