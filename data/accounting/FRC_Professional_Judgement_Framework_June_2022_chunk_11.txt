the senior manager to consider alternative team structures, such as the use of an auditor’s valuations expert to provide the relevant expertise. It is important to spend appropriate time and effort identifying the alternatives that will be judged between; a judgement may be critically impaired if a viable alternative is missed at this step. Professional scepticism is especially relevant here, as there may be instances where information has been presented (for example by management of the audited entity) in a way that artificially constrains the range of possible outcomes. It is equally possible that the auditor themselves has been insufficiently aware of mindset traps and biases in defining a range of options to consider. In either case this may be due to bias or error, and the auditor must therefore have an ingrained mindset of professional scepticism in order to assess the appropriate range of possibilities. Many biases can cause the auditor’s attention to be unduly narrowed, which could cause them to fail to consider a viable alternative.

The effectiveness of this part of the process is directly related to having already identified the right individuals to make the judgement, and proper framing of the issue. Relevant information may be drawn from various sources, including, but not limited to, the following: Enquiries with personnel at the audited entity, including those outside the entity’s finance function; Consultation with, and opinions provided by, auditor’s experts; Analysis and visualisations
