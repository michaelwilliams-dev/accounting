is not possible to reasonably quantify the value of the services provided by the volunteers, and donated services are not recognised in the financial statements. The university provides narrative disclosure of the assistance received from its volunteer librarians. Example 3 Donated services – Services that would otherwise have been purchased A public benefit entity receives pro bono legal services. The public benefit entity would otherwise have had to pay for legal services. The public benefit entity is able to make a reliable estimate of the costs it would have incurred if it had paid for the legal services, based on price it estimates it would pay in an open market. Therefore the public benefit entity recognises the value of the donated legal services as income, and a corresponding expense is also recognised. The public benefit entity provides disclosure of the nature and amount of the donated services received. Example 4 Donation with performance-related conditions A local sports club that is charity receives a donation from a former member, on condition that it is spent on purchasing a specific piece of sports equipment; a rowing boat costing approximately £20,000 which must be made available for use to club members. The donor makes the donation in advance of the order being placed for the boat. The sports club’s year end falls between the order being placed for the boat, and its delivery to the club. At the year end the sports club does not recognise the donation as income; it has not yet fulfilled the performance-related conditions attached to the donation which requires the purchase of the rowing boat and for it to be made available for use to members. Instead it will recognise a liability for the full amount of the donation. The sports club will disclose the unfulfilled performance-related conditions
