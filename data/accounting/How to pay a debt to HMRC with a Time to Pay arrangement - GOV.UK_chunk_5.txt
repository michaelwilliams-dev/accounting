We expect you to pay 50% rather than 100% because we want: your arrangement to be sustainable for you to be able to manage any unexpected changes in expenditure You may wish to pay more than 50% to reduce the amount of interest you pay. If you have a high disposable income but still need more time to pay, we’ll work with you to agree a level of payment that balances clearing the debt quickly with your reasonable monthly expenses. This may mean that you pay more than 50% of your disposable income. If your income and expenditure information shows that you do not have enough disposable income, we’ll pause our collection activity until your circumstances change. The length of the arrangement will depend on how much you owe. There’s no upper limit on the length of an arrangement. Your time to pay will be based on the information you have shared with us. We’ll make sure that your monthly payment reflects what you can afford to pay so that it’s sustainable over the length of the agreement. To help us support you in doing this: be open and honest during the payment plan discussion be ready to explain unusual or large items of expenditure provide all the information we ask for We’ll usually accept what you tell us without
