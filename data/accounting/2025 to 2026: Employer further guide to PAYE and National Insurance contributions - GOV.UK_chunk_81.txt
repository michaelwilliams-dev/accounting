These changes do not alter any of the rules for calculating National Insurance other than by using the veteransÕ zero-secondary rate where appropriate. You are still required to fulÞl any other obligations associated with paying earnings, for example, administering statutory payments. The earnings will still remain part of the secondary contributorÕs pay bill for the purposes of Apprenticeship Levy. Example VeteranÕs earnings paid in 2025 to 2026 tax year for pay period (monthly): £5,000 (£4,189( VUST ) Ð £417( ST ) = £3,772) at 0% = £0 (£5,000 Ð £4,189 = £811) at 15% = £121.65 Report £121.65 in RTI using NI Category letter V for period There are no veteran equivalent category letters to B, C or J. In those circumstances, to make sure the employee pays the reduced/exempt rate they are entitled to, you should not use category V. You should claim the relief after the end of the year by making a manual claim to HMRC in the same manner as set out for the transitional year. If your employee entitles you to both the Veteran rate and any other zero rate mentioned in this section you should select the most appropriate relief but must make sure you apply the category whereby the employee receives any reduced rate entitlement. 3.9.7 National Insurance contributions Ñ zero rate of secondary rate contributions for employees working in a Freeport special tax site A 0% rate of secondary National Insurance contributions applies for employers of employees working in a Freeport special tax site up to the Freeport Upper Secondary Threshold ( FUST ).
