fixed asset is subject to a policy of revaluation its carrying amount should be its current value as at the balance sheet date. This will be met by a full valuation at least every five years and an interim valuation in year 3. Interim valuations in years 1, 2 and 4 should be carried out where it is likely that there is material change in value. (FRS 15 paragraphs 43 and 45)|After initial recognition, an entity shall measure all items of property, plant and equipment after initial recognition using the cost model or the revaluation model. Where the revaluation model is selected, this shall be applied to all items of property, plant and equipment in the same class. (FRS 102 paragraph 17.15) Provides that under the revaluation model an item of property plant and equipment whose fair value can be measured reliably shall be carried at revalued amount, being its fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Revaluations shall be made with sufficiently regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period. (FRS 102 paragraph 17.15B)| In both cases an option to revalue items of property, plant and equipment is available, however, FRS 15 is more prescriptive with regards to the regularity of valuations (ie full valuations every 5 years and interim valuations every 3 years) however FRS 102 still expects revaluations to be performed with sufficient regularity such that the carrying amount does not differ materially from the fair value at the balance sheet date. There is also a difference in valuation basis; FRS 15 requires entities to revalue non- specialised properties on the basis of existing use value whereas FRS
