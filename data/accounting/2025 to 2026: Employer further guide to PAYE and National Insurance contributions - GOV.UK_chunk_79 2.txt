credit of £250 that month that may be used to o " set against other PAY E liabilities. Month 6 £1,800,000 (£200,000 + £200,000 + £500,000 + £500,000 + £200,000 + £200,000) + 0.5% = £9,000 Cumulative levy allowance £7,500 Levy due up to month 6 = £9,000 Ð £7,500 = £1,500 Levy paid in month 6 = levy due up to month 6 minus levy due up to month 5 = £1,500 Ð £1,750 = Ð £250 Therefore the organisation gets another credit in month 6 of £250 to set against their PAY E liabilities. The calculation continues in the same manner for each of the months 7 to 12 where the Þrm gets a credit of £250 in each month. The whole position for the year can be seen in the following table: This is an example of how the allowance will work where a unit of companies or charities split the allowance across the unit. Example 4 Ñ a unit of 3 companies (company A, company B and company C) Company A and company B are allocated an annual levy allowance of £7,500. As a consequence, company C has a levy allowance of £0. Company A and company B have monthly pay bills of £250,000 (an annual pay bill of £3 million). Company C has a monthly pay bill of £100,000 (an annual pay bill of £1.2 million) The levy to be paid for company A and company B will be calculated as follows: Month 1 £250,000 + 0.5% = £1,250 levy Cumulative levy allowance = £625 (for example, £7,500 Ö 12) Levy payable in month 1 = £1,250 Ð £625 = £625 Month 2 £500,000 (£250,000 + £250,000) + 0.5% = £2,500 Cumulative levy allowance £1,250 Levy payable to month 2 = £2,500 Ð £1,250 = £1,250 Levy paid in month 2 = levy payable to month 2 minus levy paid to month 1 = £1,250 Ð £625 = £625 And so on to month 12 £3 million (£250,000 + 12) + 0.5% = £15,000 Cumulative levy allowance £7,500 Levy payable to month 12 = £15,000 Ð £7,500 = £7,500 Levy paid in month 12 = levy payable to month 12 minus levy paid to month 11 = £7,500 Ð £6,875 = £625 The levy to be paid for company C will be calculated as follows: Month 1 £100,000 + 0.5% = £500 Cumulative levy allowance £0 Levy payable in month 1 = £500 Ð £0 = £500 Month 2 £200,000 (£100,000 + £100,000) + 0.5% = £1,000 Cumulative levy allowance = £0 Levy payable to month 2 = £1,000 Levy paid in month 2 = levy payable to month 2 minus levy paid to month 1 = £1,000 Ð £500 = £500 And so on to month 12 £1.2 million (£100,000 + 12) + 0.5% = £6,000 Cumulative levy allowance = £0 Levy payable to month 12 = £6,000 Levy paid in month 12 = levy payable to month 12 minus levy paid to month 11 = £6,000 Ð £5,500 = £500 Read Pay Apprenticeship Levy for more information on reporting and paying the Apprenticeship Levy.
