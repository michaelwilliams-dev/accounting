So, audit firms are well-served to continue investments in understanding how hybrid working necessitates new styles of audit. Challenge is inalienable to audit, and clients will be more supportive of challenge if they respect their auditors’ intellects. The sort of training described here is part of the journey of upskilling auditors to a level where they can thoughtfully provoke the (client) hands that feed them, sustaining a value-creating symbiotic mutualism, rather than a client perception of audit challenges as a distraction. Firmwide culture: Beyond employee training, auditors in a firm must implicitly feel that their organisation supports and encourages the practice of client challenge. As already noted, there is some evidence from BritainThinks to suggest that audit firms are today doing a better job in sustaining this culture of challenge than even a few years ago. But there is also evidence from the BritainThinks focus groups to suggest considerable variation across audit firms in this regard. Put differently, some firms are doing better than others, and those that are falling behind would be wise to invest in understanding what they should be doing differently in setting their firmwide culture. But embracing another firm’s culture is easier said than done. Scholars of organisational culture have noted how companies, even with a full knowledge that they are falling behind their competitors and a full understanding of what their competitors
