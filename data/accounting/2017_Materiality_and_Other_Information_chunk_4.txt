factors) and the nature (qualitative factors) of the misstatement. Examples Example 1 The Strategic Report discloses that the ongoing success of the company is attributable to organic growth. However, there has been at least one material acquisition each year for the past three years. A user of the annual report may view the company's longer term prospects differently depending on whether growth is organic or by acquisition, and therefore the auditor may determine that the failure of the directors to highlight how the acquisitions have contributed to the growth of the company is a material misstatement of the other information. Example 2 Company law requires the company to disclose political donations if the aggregate donations are in excess of a given amount. The auditor may initially determine that a donation which is above the threshold for which company law requires disclosure, but is below the auditor’s overall materiality for the audit is not quantitatively material; however, the auditor also considers qualitative factors in the assessment of materiality. The auditor's determination of whether a misstatement in the amount of political donations is material or not may vary in the specific circumstances of the entity as follows: The entity has not disclosed a donation of £2,100 – As the Companies Act threshold for disclosure is £2,000 and no disclosure is made in the annual report, the auditor is likely to conclude that this is a material misstatement. The entity has disclosed donations of £2,100, but the auditor has identified donations of £2,500 – Subject to understanding why the error has happened, the auditor may conclude that this is not a material misstatement as some donations have been disclosed, but a users’ economic decision is unlikely to be affected if the disclosure is amended in the financial statements. The entity discloses donations of
