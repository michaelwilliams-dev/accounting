assessing why management and the audit committee acted in the manner described above. FRC | Professional Judgement Guidance 16 Information on the market reaction to the delay in the results announcement; e.g. whether there was there any short selling of the shares of the listed entity. Information around what financial and operational impacts not continuing the engagement would have on the business unit and the firm as a whole, including consideration of a scenario where the tender involving the audit committee chair is unsuccessful. Based on the results of these information gathering activities, the panel will decide whether to continue the engagement, not continue, or continue conditionally on some mitigating actions being taken at the audited entity. If the panel judges the audit committee or management to have behaved inappropriately, they will consider whether there is a wider cultural issue at the entity, or if the problem is confined to a limited number of people. This may affect an assessment of whether similar behaviour is likely to happen again. If the firm does decide to continue the engagement, many of the issues considered in making judgement will be relevant for planning and performing the audit itself. Likewise, if the audit goes ahead, the firm determines that an independent audit partner should have debrief conversations with the Audit Committee Chair, the Chairman and the CFO to ascertain whether they fully understand the firmâ€™s concern with how the issue was dealt with.
