of section 510 [F845, 511A] or 516, or the outgoing auditor has previously had the opportunity to make representations with respect to an intended resolution under subsection (4) of this section or a proposed resolution under section 514(4).] On receipt of notice of F846... an intended resolution[F847mentioned in subsection (1), (1A) or (2)] the company shall forthwith send a copy of it to the person proposed to be appointed and to the outgoing auditor. The outgoing auditor may make with respect to the intended resolution representations in writing to the company (not exceeding a reasonable length) and request their notification to members of the company. The company must (unless the representations are received by it too late for it to do so)— in any notice of the resolution given to members of the company, state the fact of the representations having been made, and send a copy of the representations to every member of the company to whom notice of the meeting is or has been sent. If a copy of any such representations is not sent out as required because received too late or because of the company's default, the outgoing auditor may (without prejudice to his right to be heard orally) require that the representations be read out at the meeting. Copies of the representations need not be sent out and the representations need not be read at the meeting if, on the application either of the company or of any other person claiming to be aggrieved, the court is satisfied that the auditor is using the provisions of this section to secure needless publicity for defamatory matter.
