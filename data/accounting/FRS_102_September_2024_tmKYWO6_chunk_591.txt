applying IFRS 9 will need to consider an override of the Regulations for the purposes of giving a true and fair view, in order to recognise certain fair value gains or losses in other comprehensive income. Investments in shares B11.30 Prior to the Triennial review 2017 amendments, FRS 102 required investments in non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable ordinary shares or preference shares to be measured at fair value (unless they cannot be measured reliably). This requirement was based on the legal form of the instruments and created an anomaly whereby certain preference shares that are liabilities of the issuer (and measured at amortised cost) were treated differently by the holder. B11.31 The reference to such investments in shares was amended to non-derivative financial instruments that are equity of the issuer. This simplified the drafting, but also improved the accounting for those instruments that are liabilities of the issuer by requiring measurement at amortised cost (if the instrument is classified as ‘basic’). Directors’ loans B11.32 Many stakeholders provided feedback on the accounting for directors’ loans. Prior to the Triennial review 2017 amendments, FRS 102 required all financing transactions (except public benefit entity concessionary loans) to be measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument. This included directors’ loans (ie loans from a director to a company in which that director is also a shareholder) that are non-interest bearing, or bear interest at a non-market rate. The FRC continues to believe that this is generally appropriate accounting which reflects the fact that such transactions contain both an interest-bearing loan and the transfer of value representing the saving compared to market rates of interest. B11.33 However, concerns were raised about some of the practicalities of the accounting requirements, in particular
