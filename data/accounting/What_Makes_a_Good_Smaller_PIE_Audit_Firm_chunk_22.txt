What to expect from supervision and inspection by the FRC Introduction and context As the UK Competent Authority for statutory audit, the FRC is required by law to oversee the conduct of UK statutory audits and the firms that undertake them.

PBS tailors its oversight work to explore the existence of perceived differences between the RSB and FRC oversight regimes. Where differences are identified, the impact will be assessed, and proportionate actions proposed to bring greater consistency. The FRC conducts a range of supervision and inspection activities with PIE audit firms, which may differ in process and scope to those conducted by the RSBs.
