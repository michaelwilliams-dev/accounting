sub-group (including the intermediate parent itself) and the entities in the larger group if the intermediate parent is not wholly owned by the parent of that larger group. Key management personnel services from management entities In December 2013, the IASB amended IAS 24 in its Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010–2012 Cycle in respect of key management services as follows: Insertion of paragraph 9(b)(viii) changing the definition of a related party to clarify that a management entity that provides key management personnel services to the reporting entity is a related party. Insertion of paragraph 17A, which states that where an entity obtains key management personnel services from a management entity, it is not required to apply paragraph 17 which requires disclosure of key management personnel compensation. Insertion of paragraph 18A, which requires an entity that obtains key management personnel services from a management entity to disclose amounts incurred for the provision of those services. FRS 101 already allowed an exemption from paragraph 17 of IAS 24 (which requires disclosure of key management personnel compensation) on the basis that company law requires disclosure of directors’ emoluments, and further information about key management personnel compensation is unlikely to be relevant to the users of a qualifying entity’s financial statements. Therefore, an exemption from paragraph 18A was introduced. IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements Equity method in separate financial statements In August 2014, the IASB amended IAS 27 permitting the use of the equity method in separate financial statements. In 2015, company law was changed as a result of the implementation of the EU Accounting Directive. The use of the equity method in an entity’s individual financial statements is now permitted for entities applying Schedule 1 to the Regulations. This is not the case for entities applying Schedule 2 or Schedule 3 to the Regulations.
