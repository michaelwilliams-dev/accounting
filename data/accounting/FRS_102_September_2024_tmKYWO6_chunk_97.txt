a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price (eg an input from a dealer market), the price within the bid-ask spread that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances shall be used to measure fair value. The use of bid prices for asset positions and ask prices for liability positions is permitted, but is not required. This section does not preclude the use of mid‑market pricing or other pricing conventions that are used by market participants as a practical expedient for fair value measurements within a bid‑ask spread. Reliable measure of fair value 2A.19 A valuation technique would be expected to arrive at a reliable measure of the fair value if: it reasonably reflects how the market could be expected to price the asset; and the inputs to the valuation technique reasonably represent market expectations and measures of the risk return factors inherent in the asset. 2A.20 Valuation techniques, or the use of multiple techniques, can often produce a range of reasonable valuations. The selection of the most appropriate fair value within the range requires judgement, considering qualitative and quantitative factors specific to the measurement. 2A.21 A fair value selected from within a range of reasonable valuations is a reliable measure of the fair value if: the range of reasonable fair value measures is not significant; or the probabilities of the various measures within the range can be reasonably assessed and used to select the most appropriate fair value. 2A.22 There are many situations in which the range of reasonable fair value estimates of assets that do not have a quoted market price is likely not to be significant. Normally it is possible to estimate the fair value of an asset that an entity has acquired from an outside party. However, if
