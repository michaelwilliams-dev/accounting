from those activities that the customer reasonably expects the entity will undertake. The assessment of whether a licence provides a customer with a right to access an entity’s intellectual property shall not include activities that result in the transfer of a good or service to the customer as those activities occur. Activities that change the substance of the intellectual property include activities that change the intellectual property’s design, content or ability to perform a function or task (eg development activities that change the content to which the customer has rights). Activities that expose the customer to positive or negative effects of those activities include activities that support or maintain the value of intellectual property (eg ongoing activities that maintain the value of the brand to which the customer has rights). If either of the criteria in paragraph 23.108 are met, the licence transfers over time because a customer receives and consumes the benefits of an entity’s performance of providing access to its intellectual property as the entity performs. An entity shall apply paragraphs 23.98 to 23.104 to select an appropriate method to measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. If neither of the criteria in paragraph 23.108 are met, the licence provides the customer with a right to use the entity’s intellectual property as it exists at the point in time at which the licence is granted. An entity shall apply paragraphs 23.85 to 23.89 to determine the point in time at which the licence transfers to the customer. Revenue cannot be recognised for a licence that provides a right to use the entity’s intellectual property before the beginning of the period during which the customer is able to use and benefit from the licence.
