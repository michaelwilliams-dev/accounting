Refund liabilities An entity shall recognise a refund liability if it receives consideration from a customer and expects to refund some or all of that consideration to the customer. For example, the terms of a fixed-price service contract may require a customer to pay upfront and may provide the customer with a full refund of the amount paid if the customer is dissatisfied with the service at any time. A refund liability is measured at the amount of consideration received (or receivable) to which the entity does not expect to be entitled (ie amounts not included in the transaction price). At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall update the estimate of the refund liability (and transaction price) to reflect any relevant changes in circumstances. An entity shall account for changes in the estimate of the transaction price in accordance with paragraphs 23.75 to 23.77. To account for a refund liability relating to a sale with a right of return, an entity shall apply paragraphs 23.51 to 23.56.
