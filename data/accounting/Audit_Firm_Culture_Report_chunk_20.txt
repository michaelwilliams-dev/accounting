less rapport with audited entities and therefore ability to challenge them. Where work environments (e.g. remote working or independent partner offices) leads to auditors working more independently and in siloes, this can create fewer opportunities for collaboration and team discussion and debate if auditors do not adapt their working styles and practices accordingly.| Lack of specific connection to behaviours|Communications that talk more generally about ‘quality’ or firm values, but which are not clearly linked to scepticism and challenge, are less effective in driving behaviours (both in terms of creating awareness and in prompting auditors to act). Outside of partner level, the positive link between quality (and therefore the behaviours) and remuneration/bonuses is not clear and therefore not effectively encouraging scepticism and challenge. There is a lack of consistency in how often and how well auditors receive feedback on behaviours related to challenge and scepticism specifically (vs. more general feedback or quality scores).| Detailed findings on cultural aspects and their impact on the exercising of desired auditor behaviours Communication and leadership Summary Most auditors within the sample felt that their firms’ ‘top down’ communications have a clear and strong focus on the importance of audit quality, as well as firm values and expected audit behaviours. Managers and above typically saw this focus as representing a shift over recent years, in terms of both the volume and tone of communications about quality. Auditors at every level also felt that conversations about quality are happening frequently on an ad hoc basis between colleagues as well as in more formal meetings and sessions. However, some formal written communications about quality and values were felt to be vague and lacking specificity, both in terms of the actual behaviours auditors should be exhibiting, and concrete examples of how to enact them in practice.
