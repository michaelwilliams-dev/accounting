to receive more than 5% of any distribution made by the company received, or could have received, payments or beneÞts from the company which are not salary but could reasonably be taken to represent payment for the services they provide to clients rights which would entitle them to receive or acquire more than 5% of the assets available for distribution in the event of a close company being wound up The ÔIR35Õ rules do not apply where the worker is only entitled to receive income from the intermediary which is all taxed as PAY E income and liable to Class 1 National Insurance contributions, and has no other rights to income or capital from the Insurance contributions, and has no other rights to income or capital from the intermediary. The ÔIR35Õ rules also apply to engagements where the intermediary is a partnership. However, they only apply if: an individual worker, or persons connected with them, is entitled to 60% or more of the partnership proÞts all or most of the partnershipÕs income in the relevant tax year is derived from the provision of services, in a form which would fall within the deÞnition of relevant engagements, to a single client or a single client and associates of that client the proÞt sharing arrangements in the partnership provide for the income of any of the partners to be based on the amount of income generated by those partners through relevant engagements Where the worker would have been an employee or an o ! ce holder of the client, but for the presence of the service company or partnership, the service company or partnership may pay the worker a salary which is liable to PAY E and National Insurance contributions. If the salary actually paid is less than the income received by the service company or partnership, from relevant engagements with a client (less certain deductions) then the balance will be deemed to have been paid to the worker as a deemed employment payment on the last day of the tax year. Legislation was introduced at Chapter 10, Part 2, ITEPA 2003 in April 2017 for public sector engagements. Part of that was the abolition of the 5% deduction for individuals operating through intermediaries in the public sector. It also shifted responsibility for determining employment status for tax from the workerÕs PSC to the organisation they work for. Large and medium-sized organisations are responsible for assessing the employment status of the contractors they engage to work for them. Where services are provided to a small non-public sector client, the intermediary will be responsible for determining status and operating PAY E and paying National Insurance contributions under Chapter 8, Part 2, ITEPA 2003 if the rules apply as follows. Intermediaries which are companies Where a workerÕs intermediary is a company and receives income in respect of relevant engagements: the intermediary must operate PAY E and pay National Insurance contributions on payments of salary to the worker during the year, in the normal way if at the end of the tax year, the total of the workerÕs employment income from the intermediary, including beneÞts in kind, amounts to less than the intermediaryÕs income from all that workerÕs relevant engagements, then the di " erence (net of allowable expenses ) will be deemed to have been paid to the worker as earnings on 5 April (earlier in certain circumstances), and tax and National Insurance contributions must be paid accordingly responsibility for determining employment status for tax lies with the client they work for in the public sector medium and large-sized organisations are responsible for assessing
