paragraph 23.84). An asset created by an entity’s performance does not have alternative use if the entity is either: restricted contractually from readily directing the asset for another use during its creation or enhancement, because the customer could enforce its rights to that promised asset; or limited practically from readily directing the asset in its completed state for another use, because the entity would incur significant economic losses in doing so. The assessment of whether an asset has an alternative use to the entity is made at contract inception and shall be reassessed only if there is a contract modification that substantially changes the performance obligation. An enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date may arise from specific terms in the contract or laws that apply to that contract. At all times throughout the duration of the contract, the entity must be entitled to an amount that at least compensates the entity for performance completed to date if the contract is terminated for reasons other than the entity’s failure to perform as promised. An amount that would compensate an entity for performance completed to date would be an amount that approximates the selling price of the goods or services transferred to date (eg recovery of the cost incurred by the entity in satisfying the performance obligation plus a reasonable profit margin). Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time If a performance obligation is not satisfied over time, an entity satisfies the performance obligation at a point in time. To determine the point in time at which a customer obtains control of a promised asset, an entity shall consider indicators of the transfer of control, which include but are not limited to the following: the entity has a present right to payment for the asset; the customer has
