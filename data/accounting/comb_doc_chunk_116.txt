Paragraph 11.22 sets out examples of observable data that might be considered as objective evidence that a loss has occurred (eg the death of a debtor). In the absence of any objective evidence or observable data indicating that a loss has occurred, there is no basis for recognising an impairment, or bad debt provision. Individual financial assets An entity needs to assess financial assets for impairment individually in the following circumstances: Where the entity does not routinely provide credit, either at all, or to certain types of debtor, the entity should consider whether those assets should be part of a group of assets with similar credit characteristics, and if not they must be assessed for impairment individually; Where the financial asset is individually significant; or Where there is specific information about the credit risk of that financial asset (regardless of whether or not it is part of a group of financial assets with similar credit characteristics). A group of financial assets Paragraph 11.22(e) states that where observable data indicates that there has been a measureable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a group of financial assets, even though the decrease cannot yet be identified on an individual asset basis, this is objective evidence that an impairment has occurred. To apply this in practice, it may be necessary to identify groups of debtors within the overall portfolio that have similar credit risk characteristics (eg trade debtors with the same geographical location or industry sector or demographic) and then estimate the loss that is expected from that group. It is reasonable to make use of historical loss experience as a basis for this estimate, but it should be adjusted to: reflect the effect of current conditions that did not affect the period on which the historical loss experience is based;
