payment. That further payment, and any deductions made from it, should be entered onto the return for the month in which it’s paid. The total of payments made and any deductions should then be correct, overall. Subcontractor is overpaid in error If the contractor overpays the subcontractor, for example, by making a payment of £3,000 instead of the £2,000 due, then the monthly return should reflect the amount of the payment made, that is, £3,000. How that is then corrected for CIS will depend on the approach that the contractor adopts. If the subcontractor’s engagement continues into the following month, the contractor may agree with the subcontractor to pay £1,000, instead of the £2,000 due. This will balance out the payments and the contractor simply needs to enter the £1,000 paid in the second month on the return for that month. If the subcontractor is paid under deduction, the same principle will apply. For the first month in this example, assuming a deduction rate of 20%, there would be a net payment of £2,400 and a deduction of £600 and, in the second, a net payment of £800 and a deduction of £200. The payment statements provided to the subcontractor each month would also reflect those figures. Where the subcontractor’s contract has ended and no further payments are due, from which to take a previous month’s overpayment, the steps to be taken by the contractor depend on what action is taken to recover the overpayment. If the contractor stops the cheque or the subcontractor returns it without cashing it, the contractor should reissue the payment in the correct amount, retrieve and reissue the subcontractor’s payment statement and contact us to report the error on the earlier return. The revised payment and any deductions should be recorded on the next monthly
