date during the current period, the change in accounting shall take place from that date, which may not be the first day of a reporting period, in order that the benefits to users of defined benefit accounting are not delayed; for a date during a prior period, after the financial statements for that period have been authorised for issue, the change in accounting shall take place from the first day of the current period, with no restatement of comparatives as those financial statements were prepared on the basis of the information available at the time; and for a date during the prior period, before those financial statements have been authorised for issue, the change in accounting shall take place from that date (as an adjusting event after the end of the reporting period). B28.8E When an entity accounts for a multi-employer defined benefit plan as if it were a defined contribution plan, paragraph 28.11A requires it to recognise a liability for any contributions payable that arise from an agreement to fund a deficit. The change to defined benefit accounting can then be seen as a change to an improved measurement basis, using more complete information, to measure the same underlying obligation, and the amount to be recognised in the statement of financial position is likely to change, creating a ‘difference’ to be recognised on transition. B28.8F Items can only be recognised in other comprehensive income when FRS 102 specifically requires or permits it. Following the amendment made in May 2019, the difference between any existing liability arising from a schedule of contributions and the net defined benefit liability (which is a defined term and could also be an asset), at the date of transition shall be recognised in other comprehensive income. This means that the existing provision is not derecognised
