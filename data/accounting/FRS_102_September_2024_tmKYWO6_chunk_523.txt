such as advertising and promotional material. As the items will be distributed at no or nominal cost, the net realisable value will usually be lower than the purchase price. A3.37 Paragraph 13.4A of FRS 102 requires inventories held for distribution at no or nominal cost to be measured at the lower of cost (adjusted for any loss in service potential) and replacement cost. This is an application of fair value accounting. For inventories, including those held for distribution at no or nominal value (particularly items distributed to beneficiaries by public benefit entities), there is unlikely to be a significant difference between replacement cost and fair value. Amortisation of intangible assets A3.37A Paragraph 22 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations requires intangible assets to be written off over their useful economic lives. This is broadly consistent with paragraph 18.21 of FRS 102, except that FRS 102 allows for the possibility that an intangible asset will have a residual value, in which case it is the depreciable amount that shall be amortised, not the cost (or revalued amount) of the intangible asset. In practice it will be uncommon for an intangible asset to have a residual value (paragraph 18.23 requires an entity to assume that the residual value is zero other than in specific circumstances). In those cases where an intangible asset has a residual value that is not zero, the amortisation of the depreciable amount of an intangible asset over its useful economic life is a departure from the requirements of paragraph 22 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations for the overriding purpose of giving a true and fair view. In these circumstances entities must provide, in the notes to the financial statements, the ‘particulars of the departure, the reasons for it and its effect’ (paragraph 10(2) of Schedule 1 to
