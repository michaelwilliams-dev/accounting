Paragraph 52(2) of Schedule 3 to the Regulations requires that a summary of the principal assumptions in making the long-term business provision shall be given in the notes to the financial statements. In order to comply with this requirement an entity should disclose for each principal category of business the more significant assumptions relating to the following: premiums; persistency; mortality and morbidity; interest rates; the discount rates used with, if relevant, explanation of the basis of reflecting risk margins; and if applicable, any other significant factors. IG2.44 Where the long-term business provision has been determined on an actuarial basis that, in assessing the future net cash flows, has regard to the timing of tax relief where assumed expenses exceed attributable income, such tax relief should be excluded from the determination of deferred tax. Paragraphs IG2.45 and IG2.46 provide guidance for applying the requirements of Section 5 of FRS 103. They are only relevant to long-term insurance business. IG2.45 For each significant class of with-profits insurance business, the insurer should disclose the extent to which the basis of preparation of the long-term business provision incorporates allowance for future bonuses. For example, it should be stated (if it is the case) that explicit provision is made only for vested bonuses (including those vesting following the current valuation) and that no such provision is made for future regular or terminal bonuses. If practical, insurers should disclose the amount that has been included explicitly in the long-term business provision in relation to future bonuses provided this can be done without undue cost or effort. If the valuation method makes implicit allowance for future bonuses by adjusting the discount rate used or by another method, this fact should be stated together with a broad description of the means by which such allowance is made.
