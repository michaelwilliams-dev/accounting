of liabilities takes account of a value for that interest at an amount in excess of the net amounts that would be included in the entity’s consolidated accounts, an amount may be recognised representing this excess. As explained in paragraph 3.15 of FRS 103 this situation could arise where the subsidiary or associate writes non-participating business and the value of the subsidiary or associate incorporates the VIF of non-participating business written in the subsidiary or associate. The value of the subsidiary or associate is reduced by the subsidiary’s or associate’s capital requirement as noted in rule 1.3.33(3) of INSPRU as at 31 December 2015. When preparing both consolidated and non-consolidated accounts, the excess value that may be recognised should therefore be taken as the excess before deduction of the subsidiary’s or associate’s capital requirement. IG1.10 Where the amounts on a ‘realistic’ basis determined in accordance with paragraph 3.12 of FRS 103 are different from the amounts on the MSSB, a corresponding amount is transferred to or from the FFA, so that there is no effect on equity. The potential shareholders’ share corresponding to additional bonuses to policyholders that have been included in the policyholders’ liability should be accounted for in the FFA. As a result, there will generally be no change in the profit for the reporting period except where the adjustments result in a negative balance on the FFA and the entity determines that this negative balance should result in a deduction from equity through profit or loss. Policyholders’ options and guarantees IG1.11 Entities with with-profits business within the scope of paragraph 3.1(b) of FRS 103 are required to measure the liability of that business in respect of options and guarantees relating to policyholders either at fair value or at an amount estimated using a market-consistent stochastic model.
