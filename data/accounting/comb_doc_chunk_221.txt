a parent and its subsidiary Loans between parents and their subsidiaries are often made on interest-free terms. It can be presumed that a loan is made on these terms because the parent owns and controls its subsidiary. A fixed term interest free-loan consists, in substance, of two components: a loan at a market rate of interest; and a benefit or contribution to the borrower. In the case of an interest-free loan between a parent and its subsidiary, the first component, ie the loan made at a market-rate of interest, is determined by calculating the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest of a similar loan. The second component, ie the gift or contribution to the borrower, is the measurement difference which is accounted for as a capital contribution or distribution. The accounting is demonstrated in the numerical examples below. A parent provides a fixed term interest-free loan of CU1,000 to its subsidiary. The present value of the loan using a market rate of interest for a similar loan is CU9002. The difference of CU100 represents an additional investment by the parent in the subsidiary. The parent would record the following accounting entries in its individual financial statements: Dr Loan receivable from subsidiary3 CU900 Dr Investment in subsidiary3 CU100 Cr Cash CU1,000 The subsidiary would record the following accounting entries: Dr Cash CU1,000 Cr Loan repayable to parent CU900 Cr Capital contribution (equity) CU100 2 See Example 6 below for the calculation of the present value and a demonstration of the subsequent accounting for an interest-free loan. 3 Loans and investments are subject to impairment. An entity shall apply the relevant accounting requirements in FRS 102 to determine whether a loan or investment is impaired. A subsidiary provides a fixed term interest-free loan of CU1,000
