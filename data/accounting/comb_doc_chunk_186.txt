asset or a financial liability, at fair value, when an entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Consequently financial assets of CU15,000 and financial liabilities of CU17,000 have been recognised in the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2014. Financial assets of CU18,000 and financial liabilities of CU17,000 have been recognised in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014. Derivatives are measured to fair value with gains (losses) from changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. The effect on profit for the year ended 31 December 2014 is an increase of CU3,000. The derivative financial instruments are foreign exchange forward contracts. In applying SSAP 20 Foreign currency translation, Entity F previously chose to translate purchases in foreign currencies at the rate of exchange specified in a matching forward contract. This is not permitted by FRS 102, which requires purchases to be translated using the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. FRS 102 does not provide an exemption from measuring stock bought in a foreign currency and paid for before the transition date in accordance with its required accounting policies, but the difference is not material and accordingly no adjustment has been made. Items purchased since the transition date have been re-measured based on spot exchange rate. Consequently stock at 31 December 2014 has been reduced and cost of sales for the year end has been increased by CU1,000 and costs of CU2,000 have been reclassified as administrative expenses rather than cost of sales. Short-term compensated absences Prior to applying FRS 102, Entity F did not make provision for holiday pay (ie holiday earned but not taken prior to the year-end). FRS 102 requires the cost of short-term compensated absences to be recognised when employees render the service that increases their entitlement.
