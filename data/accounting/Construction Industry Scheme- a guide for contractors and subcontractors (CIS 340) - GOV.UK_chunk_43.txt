year for tree felling. Tree felling is not normally a construction operation in itself, but if the trees are cut down as part of work to clear a site ready to build a housing estate or a road, payments for the tree felling will be within the scheme. This means that it is not possible simply to look at the types of work carried out by a business to decide whether the business is a contractor or subcontractor. Contracts for the work will sometimes be covered by the scheme and sometimes will not. Contracts that do not specifically provide for construction operations Construction operations refers not only to particular works, but also to the work that people need to do to carry out those operations. This means that a contract relating to construction operations could include a contract that did not specifically provide for operations, but which did provide for the provision of labour to carry out those operations. An example of this would be where a subcontractor was under a duty to provide the labour of scaﬀolders to a contractor. The work of scaﬀolders is within the scheme when it’s preparatory or integral to construction operations taking place. Construction operations The rest of this appendix gives guidance on operations that are regarded as construction operations within the scheme and operations that are regarded as non- construction operations. Read these paragraphs alongside the table in Appendix C. The information in this guidance note is not exhaustive.
