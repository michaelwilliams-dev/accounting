provided and consult with relevant parties within the FRC, including the Conduct Committee, about the appropriate outcome. If the outcome is that a matter should be referred formally to the Conduct Committee to consider opening an investigation, then the team will prepare a referral paper. Refer to section 5 for more information about the Conduct Committee and investigation process. If the outcome is that a matter is suitable for resolution through constructive engagement, the team will refer it to the relevant AFS Supervisor to resolve and the firm will be notified accordingly. AFS will make further enquiries with the firm and seek appropriate remedial actions to address and mitigate the risk of the issue recurring. If the outcome is that no further action is necessary, the firm will be notified and the enquiry will be closed. What we expect from firms Firms must co-operate fully with an enquiry by the Case Assessment team and provide the information requested in full and on a timely basis. If a firm considers that it may not be able to comply, it must inform the team at the earliest opportunity and not, for example, wait until the deadline for satisfying the request has been reached. We will take into account all reasonable requests for the extension of a deadline. The FRC may take formal action if the requirements of a Notice are not complied with. Inspection of audit files The FRC has a statutory responsibility to inspect the audit work conducted by firms. This inspection work on PIE audits is conducted by AQR. The FRC has delegated responsibility for the inspection of non-PIE audits to the RSBs. The RSBs are responsible for planning their inspection work but we engage with them with the aim of avoiding, where possible, FRC and RSB inspection visits occurring
