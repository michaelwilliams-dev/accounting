each lasting 45 minutes, with a total of three one- on-one interviews per firm. Unlike the auditor focus groups, where participants were randomly selected, partners were specifically selected as demonstrating good quality audit. In-depth interviews offered the best format for partners, as this created opportunities to hear from them both on what makes a good environment for scepticism and challenge, and ways audit firm culture could be improved to ensure consistently high audit quality throughout the firm. Limitations of the research approach This qualitative research approach has two key limitations compared to alternative methods: By nature, qualitative approaches focus on providing an indicative or reflective picture of an audience or issue, rather than a definitive or representative account of that audience or issue. A number of steps were taken to counteract this inherent limitation, including: Achieving a relatively large sample size for a qualitative research project, of more than 100 auditors in total across the auditor focus groups and partner interviews. Taking a random sampling approach to recruitment for the auditor focus groups, rather than relying on firms to put forward auditors and risking introducing bias into the sample. Qualitative approaches can offer less anonymity than quantitative surveys, particularly in group discussions where participants can see and hear the views of other participants in the research, but must still feel comfortable being open and honest. This is particularly important in the context where views on the topics of firm culture, professional scepticism and effective challenge may be sensitive for some auditors, especially if they feel these are not working effectively. A number of steps were taken to minimise this impact and to ensure that participants felt comfortable sharing their views and that their anonymity would be protected as far as possible, including: Emphasising the engagement of an independent research agency
