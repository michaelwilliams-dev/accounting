DATA_REQUEST Message Source/Destination Portal/Client application to the Transaction Engine Processing The DATA_REQUEST message enables a client to request the details of the document submissions that the Transaction Engine is currently handling for them. The Class of the document filters the returned list of CorrelationIDs to that type of document. The client can also indicate date/time ranges to further narrow the search. The client may send a DATA_REQUEST message if it has not received a reply from the Transaction Engine after the PollInterval timeout value supplied on the previous Transaction Engine message (SUBMISSION_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, SUBMISSION_RESPONSE or ERROR_RESPONSE) has expired. The DATA_REQUEST message must be authenticated, and therefore requires the same credentials to be presented by the Portal/client application as were used when submitting the original document. The DATA_RESPONSE message returned from the Transaction Engine will list the documents that matched the criteria in the DATA_REQUEST. The client can therefore determine if the submitted document is being handled by the Transaction Engine by virtue of the fact that the document appears in the DATA_RESPONSE. Documents that have been deleted from the Transaction Engine will not appear in the DATA_RESPONSE. The client should act promptly on documents if concerned about their status - for example the Transaction Engine will remove: Successful Business responses received from the Department after 60 days Business Error responses received from the Department after 30 days The results set, if any, produced by a DATA_REQUEST will be contained in the body elements of a DATA_RESPONSE message.
