Subject to certain conditions and exclusions, the qualifying conditions are met by a company in a year in which it does not exceed two or more of the following criteria: Turnover £10.2 million Balance sheet total £5.1 million Average number of employees 50 A3.11B A parent company qualifies as a small company in relation to a financial year only if the group that it heads qualifies as small (as set out in section 383 of the Act).

A3.11D In accordance with section 393 of the Act the directors of any company, including a small company, must not approve accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company. In order to achieve this, a company, including a small company, may need to provide disclosures additional to those required by company law. In relation to small companies, paragraph 1A.5 of FRS 102 reflects this requirement and paragraph 1A.6 refers to the need to consider providing additional disclosures in order to comply with it. A3.11E The Small Companies Regulations include options for small companies to prepare an abridged balance sheet and an abridged profit and loss account. In order to take this option small companies must comply with the additional legal requirement that all members of the company have given consent to the drawing up of abridged financial statements (which may only be given in respect of the preceding financial year).
