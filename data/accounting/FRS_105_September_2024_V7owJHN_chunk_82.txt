one-year bonds and 7% for two-year and three-year bonds). Calculation of the present value, at the end of 20X0, of the estimated cash flows related to the warranties for products sold in 20X0 is as follows: Year||Expected cash payments (CU)|Discount rate|Discount factor|Present value (CU)| 1|60% ×|2,760|6%|0.9434|2,604| |CU4,600|||(at 6% for 1 year)|| 2|30% ×|1,380|7%|0.8734|1,205| |CU4,600|||(at 7% for 2 years)|| 3|10% ×|460|7%|0.8163|375| |CU4,600|||(at 7% for 3 years)|| Total|||||4,184| The micro-entity will recognise a warranty obligation of CU4,184 at the end of 20X0 for products sold in 20X0. Example 4 16A.4 [Deleted] Example 5 Closure of a division: no implementation before end of reporting period 16A.5 On 12 December 20X0 the board of a micro-entity decided to close down a division. Before the end of the reporting period (31 December 20X0) the decision was not communicated to any of those affected and no other steps were taken to implement the decision. Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event: There has been no obligating event, and so there is no obligation. Conclusion: The micro-entity does not recognise a provision. Example 6 Closure of a division: communication and implementation before end of reporting period 16A.6 On 12 December 20X0 the board of a micro-entity decided to close a division making a particular product. On 20 December 20X0 a detailed plan for closing the division was agreed by the board, letters were sent to customers warning them to seek an alternative source of supply, and redundancy notices were sent to the staff of the division. Present obligation as a result of a past obligating event: The obligating event is the communication of the decision to the customers and employees, which gives rise to a constructive obligation from that date, because it creates a valid expectation that the division will be closed.
