reflect the commercial substance. Contracts for multiple services UITF Abstract 40|FRS 102| Only contracts for services that constitute a single service, or a number of services that constitute a single project, are accounted for as long-term contracts. (UITF Abstract 40 paragraph 11 and 24) A contract to provide services on an on- going basis, for example a contract to provide repetitive services, is not accounted for as a long-term contract. (UITF Abstract 40 paragraph 12 and 26) Therefore, the entity would recognise revenue when and to the extent that it obtained the right to consideration in exchange for performance under FRS 5, which would be on the basis of each service performed.|For a contract for services, where those services are performed by an indeterminate number of acts over a specified period of time, an entity recognises revenue on a straight-line basis over the specified period unless there is evidence that some other method better represents the stage of completion. (FRS 102 paragraph 23.15)| In practice, since under current UK accounting standards revenue would be recognised as each service (or number of services that constitute a single project) is performed and under FRS 102 revenue would be recognised using a method representing the stage of completion, the recognition of revenue would generally be the same under both standards.
