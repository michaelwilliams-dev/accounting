of the financial asset or liability at initial recognition. Under the effective interest method: the amortised cost of a financial asset (liability) is the present value of future cash receipts (payments) discounted at the effective interest rate; and the interest expense (income) in a period equals the carrying amount of the financial liability (asset) at the beginning of a period multiplied by the effective interest rate for the period. Effective interest method In accordance with paragraph 11.14(a) of FRS 102 debt instruments that meet the conditions of paragraphs 11.8(b) and 11.9 shall, following initial recognition, be measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments include basic types of financial assets and liabilities, eg trade receivables and payables and variable or fixed rate loans. Please note that paragraph 11.14(b) also provides an alternative accounting treatment and entities may elect to measure their debt instruments at fair value which is not discussed further in this document. Paragraphs 11.15 and 11.16 of FRS 102 (reproduced above) set out the basic principles of an amortised cost calculation and describe how the effective interest method should be applied. The effective interest rate of a debt instrument may equal its coupon rate, but, often an entity will also incur other costs or receive other income associated with the instrument, eg finance charges or premiums and discounts which affect the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate includes, besides interest, other related finance fees and charges (refer also to paragraph 11.18 of FRS 102). Please also refer to the example of an amortisation cost calculation in Section 11 of FRS 102. It is not expected that accounting differences will arise in respect of the determination of the effective interest rate when transitioning to FRS 102, since similar principles apply under FRS 4 Capital Instruments,
