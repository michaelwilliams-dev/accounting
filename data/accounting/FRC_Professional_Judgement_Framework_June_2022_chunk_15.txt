The auditor will need to exercise professional judgement in considering the specifics of the situation and the requirements of the ISAs (UK) in order to determine what documentation is required.

Auditing standards set specific requirements covering some key forms of communication, including those to those charged with governance (likely the audit committee),10 and in the auditor’s report.11 Following a rigorous professional judgment process, such as the one presented here, should assist such communications by providing a structure that allows the auditor to more clearly communicate the process followed and judgment reached.
