Subsequent measurement Subsequent measurement of the right-of-use asset After the commencement date, a lessee shall measure the right-of-use asset applying the cost model, unless it applies the fair value model for investment property as described in paragraph 20.60 or the revaluation model for property, plant and equipment as described in paragraph 20.61. Cost model To apply the cost model, a lessee shall measure the right-of-use asset at cost: less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses; and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability specified in paragraph 20.62(c).

Otherwise, the lessee shall depreciate the right-of-use asset from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.

If right-of-use assets relate to a class of property, plant and equipment to which the lessee applies the revaluation model in Section 17, a lessee may elect to apply that revaluation model to all of
