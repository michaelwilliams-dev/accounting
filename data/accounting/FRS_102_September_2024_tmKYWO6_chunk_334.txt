value of money If payment is deferred beyond normal business terms or is financed (by the entity) at a rate of interest that is not market rate, the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction (see paragraphs 11.13 and 12.7). An entity shall adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money and recognise the interest revenue in accordance with Section 11 or Section 12. The entity shall present interest revenue separately from revenue from contracts with customers. If payment is received in advance, an entity may adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money and recognise the resulting interest expense in accordance with Section 11 or Section 12. An entity need not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the entity expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the entity transfers the good or service promised to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be 12 months or less (see paragraph 11.13A(c)). Non-cash consideration To determine the transaction price for contracts in which a customer promises consideration in a form other than cash, an entity shall measure the non-cash consideration (or promise of non-cash consideration) at fair value. If an entity cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the non-cash consideration, the entity shall measure the consideration indirectly by reference to the stand-alone selling price of the goods or services promised to the customer (or class of customer) in exchange for the consideration. Consideration payable to a customer Consideration payable to a customer includes cash amounts that an entity pays, or expects to pay, to the customer (or to other parties that purchase the entityâ€™s goods or services from the customer).
