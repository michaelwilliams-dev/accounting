The requirements of FRS 102 have resulted in more information being available to users about the financial instruments held by a reporting entity, and therefore should have improved usersâ€™ understanding of the instruments and the associated risks. Stakeholder feedback suggested that this was one of the most challenging aspects of implementing FRS 102.

Incremental improvements and clarifications Respondents supported the idea that the Triennial Review 2017 should focus on incremental improvements and clarifications. Although these amendments were effective from 1 January 2019 (four years after the initial effective date of FRS 102 and three years after small entities were brought within its scope), at that time many entities had prepared no more than one or two sets of financial statements applying FRS 102 and respondents supported and emphasised the importance of allowing FRS 102 to bed down and become more familiar before more fundamental changes were proposed. The amendments to FRS 102 were intended to improve the quality of financial reporting, the usability of the standard and/or the cost-effectiveness of the standard. 80 See also University of Worcester Business School research on behalf of the Institute of Financial Accountants, Final Report (December 2016).

The FRC agrees with respondents that, in most cases, it will be preferable
