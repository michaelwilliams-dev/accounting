The FRC will review FRS 101 annually to ensure that the reduced disclosure framework continues to be effective in providing disclosure reductions for qualifying entities when compared with adopted IFRS. 11 This reflects the standards referenced in UK company law at the time, prior to the UK exit from the European Union (see paragraph 81 of this Basis for Conclusions). Table 2 to this Basis for Conclusions sets out the IASB publications considered in the development of FRS 101 to date. These publications were reviewed in the context of the reduced disclosure framework for any amendments that: altered disclosure requirements for consideration as to whether changes to the disclosure exemptions included in FRS 101 were necessary; and/or were inconsistent with legal requirements for consideration as to whether changes to the Application Guidance Amendments to adopted IFRS for compliance with the Act and the Regulations to FRS 101 were necessary. Scope During the development of FRS 101, early exposure drafts proposed that only qualifying subsidiaries could apply the reduced disclosure framework; however, this was extended in later proposals so that the ultimate parent of a group may take advantage of the reduced disclosure framework in its individual financial statements. In clarifying the scope of FRS 101, a qualifying entity which is required to prepare consolidated financial statements (for example, if the entity is required by section 399 of the Act to prepare group accounts, and is not entitled to any of the exemptions in sections 400 to 402 of the Act), or a qualifying entity which voluntarily chooses to prepare consolidated financial statements, should not be permitted to apply the reduced disclosure framework in its consolidated financial statements. It was recognised that entities which are required or voluntarily choose to prepare consolidated financial statements generally have users with greater information requirements
