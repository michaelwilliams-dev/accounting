FRC Professional Judgement Guidance Expectations Paper June 2022 FRC Professional Judgement Framework Executive Summary The FRC has developed a Professional Judgement Framework with a working group of audit practitioners, independent experts and colleagues from FRC Enforcement and Supervision. This paper sets out the status of the guidance, and the FRC’s expectations about how it might be used by practitioners to drive enhanced audit quality. We intend for the Framework to have the status of non-prescriptive guidance. This is consistent with a range of other guidance (Practice Notes for example) which: are persuasive rather than prescriptive and are indicative of good practice…. Auditors should be aware of and consider Practice Notes applicable to the engagement. Auditors who do not consider and apply the guidance included in a relevant Practice Note should be prepared to explain how the engagement standards have been complied with.1 The fact that the Framework is non-prescriptive does not mean that audit practitioners in the UK should disregard it. Practitioners are therefore expected to be aware of guidance that we issue, and to consider its relevance to audit and assurance engagements. The Framework, and the associated working examples that have been included with it, can be applied to multiple circumstances and in a variety of ways. Our intent is that: It can be applied at a firm-wide level, and potentially incorporated into the firm’s methodology; It may be an important consideration in the development of a Quality Management System in accordance with ISQM (UK) 1; It can also be applied in the circumstances of an individual audit engagement as a stand-alone guide to the application of professional judgement; It can be used by individual practitioners at any level of seniority in the conduct of an audit or assurance engagement, and provides high level principles and a benchmark for
