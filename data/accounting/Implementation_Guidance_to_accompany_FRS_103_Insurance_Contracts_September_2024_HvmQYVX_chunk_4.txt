future transfers to shareholders calculated using market consistent financial assumptions, and assuming that transfers take place at a level consistent with those assumptions used to calculate the realistic value of liabilities. Where an explicit assumption is not required in order to calculate the liabilities then continuation of the current profit sharing arrangements should be assumed unless the firm has plans to change this approach. Non-economic projection assumptions should be consistent with those used in determining the realistic value of liabilities. The amount deducted in accordance with this paragraph should be taken to the fund for future appropriations (FFA). If shareholders transfers have been included as part of the realistic value of liabilities (or otherwise included in liabilities) then the amount of such transfers should be taken out of liabilities and included in the FFA, together with any related tax liability. If shareholders transfers have not been set up as part of the realistic value of liabilities or elsewhere, no adjustment is required. IG1.3 In determining the realistic value of liabilities, a with-profits life fund may take account of the value of future profits expected to arise from any non-participating business that forms part of the with-profits fund – sometimes referred to as the value of in-force life assurance business (VIF). Excluding the VIF from the statement of financial position whilst recognising the realistic value of liabilities in full, and valuing the non-participating liabilities in the with-profits fund on a statutory basis, would give rise to an inconsistency in the fund’s net assets. An entity is therefore permitted to recognise the VIF if that business has been taken into account in measuring the liability, in the circumstances of paragraph 3.12(c) of FRS 103, even though there is not a direct link between the value of the asset and the amount of
