the requirement for tax expense (income) to be allocated to the same account (technical or non-technical) as the transaction or other event that resulted in the tax expense (income) means that the amount shown in the non-technical account as the transfer from (to) the long-term business technical account is net of tax. There is therefore a requirement for the tax attributable to the transfer to be brought into account in arriving at profit before tax in the non-technical account. IG2.80 Entities should determine the amount to be brought into account in the non-technical account in respect of the transfer from (to) the long-term business technical account using a method which is consistent with the approach in paragraph 29.22 of FRS 102 and which fairly represents that part of the tax expense (income) in the long-term business technical account which is based on pre-tax accounting profits or on timing differences in the recognition of such profits for accounting and tax purposes. IG2.81 The reconciliation required by paragraph 29.27(b) of FRS 102 should apply only to the tax expense (income) that appears in the non-technical account. 3 And for Irish entities.
