that the CEO is instrumental in driving a positive culture and making the right appointment to this role can have a significant effect on a company. Along with boards, committees are playing a larger role in culture – often as a way of sifting information and passing issues upwards. Unlike the audit, remuneration and nominations committees and in some cases risk committees, there is no requirement to have a culture committee or ensure that culture matters are considered as part of a committee’s remit. Companies must decide whether a dedicated committee is appropriate, or the remit included elsewhere. At the board-level, this could be audit and/or risk committees – who generally consider culture through the risk management lens, but also ethics, compliance and conduct committees. The CIPD has recently published a report arguing that remit of the remuneration committee should be expanded to include review of culture, alongside workforce pay and other people matters, rather than solely being focused on executive pay. How culture is presented and considered within a company will affect the importance it is given, and the amount of resource allocated to it. We found that most boards only discuss potential risks stemming from their organisational culture, with only a few identifying the positive aspects and opportunities that it can bring. By changing the rhetoric of how culture is perceived and by finding the underlying commonalities between different cultures and how they are approached across all functions, companies should be better equipped to benefit from a positive working culture. To help risk managers understand the broader aspects of culture, including the opportunities, Airmic will soon publish a white paper. The guidance will be based on findings from the roundtables jointly organised with the FRC and supplemented by Airmic’s further research in this area and own expertise. The
