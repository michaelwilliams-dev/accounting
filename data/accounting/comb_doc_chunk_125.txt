of the machine. Initially the cost of the machine should be allocated between the two component parts, ie CU250,000 each. Subsequently each component should be depreciated over its respective useful life. Residual value FRS 15|FRS 102| Where the residual value is material it should be reviewed at the end of each reporting period to take account of reasonably expected technological changes based on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition (or revaluation). (FRS 15 paragraph 95)|Factors such as a change in how an asset is used, significant unexpected wear and tear, technological advancement, and changes in market prices may indicate that the residual value or useful life of an asset has changed since the most recent annual reporting date. If such indicators are present, an entity shall review its previous estimates and, if current expectations differ, amend the residual value, depreciation method or useful life. (FRS 102 paragraph 17.19) Residual value is defined as the estimated amount that an entity would currently obtain from disposal of an asset, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life. (FRS 102 Glossary)| There is a difference in accounting treatment between current UK accounting standards and FRS 102 in the way that residual value is determined. FRS 102 defines residual value as the estimated amount that would currently be obtained ie it takes into account future price changes, whereas FRS 15 does not. Revaluations FRS 15|FRS 102| Permits tangible fixed assets to be revalued only where an entity adopts a policy of revaluation. That policy must be applied to all assets within individual classes of tangible fixed assets, but not necessarily to all classes of tangible fixed assets. (FRS 15 paragraph 42) Where a tangible
