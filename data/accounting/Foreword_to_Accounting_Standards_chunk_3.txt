preparing Companies Act ﬁnancial statements, and also entities that are not constituted as companies, but that are otherwise required to prepare ﬁnancial statements that are required to give a true and fair view. Financial Reporting Council 1 The FRC’s overriding objective in setting accounting standards is to enable users of accounts to receive high-quality, understandable ﬁnancial reporting proportionate to the size and complexity of the entity and users’ information needs. Identiﬁcation of accounting standards Accounting standards developed by the FRC are designated Financial Reporting Standards (FRSs). The FRC may issue FRSs that relate to other aspects of ﬁnancial reporting, but which are not accounting standards. Each FRS will indicate its status, ie that it is an accounting standard or, if not, the circumstances in which it may be applied. The FRC may issue other material with, or alongside, an FRS. This material is only part of an accounting standard when it is identiﬁed as an integral part of an FRS that is an accounting standard. Early adoption of Financial Reporting Exposure Drafts (FREDs) An exposure draft is issued for comment and is subject to revision. Until it is ﬁnalised as an accounting standard, the requirements of any existing accounting standards that would be affected by proposals in the exposure draft remain in force. Some reporting entities may wish to provide additional information reﬂecting proposals in an exposure draft. In the FRC’s view there are two ways that this can be achieved: Insofar as the information does not conﬂict with existing accounting standards, it could be incorporated into the ﬁnancial statements. It should be remembered, however, that the proposals may change before forming part of an accounting standard and the consequences of a change to the proposals should be considered. The information could be provided in supplementary form. Similar considerations apply
