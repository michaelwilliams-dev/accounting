Subsequent measurement A micro-entity shall charge against a provision only those expenditures for which the provision was originally recognised. A micro-entity shall review provisions at each reporting date and adjust them to reflect the current best estimate of the amount that would be required to settle the obligation at that reporting date. Any adjustments to the amounts previously recognised shall be recognised in profit or loss unless the provision was originally recognised as part of the cost of an asset (see paragraph 16.6). When a provision is measured at the present value of the amount expected to be required to settle the obligation, the unwinding of the discount shall be recognised as interest expense in profit or loss in the period it arises. Onerous contracts If a micro-entity has an onerous contract, the present obligation under the contract shall be recognised and measured as a provision (see Example 2 of the appendix to this section). Future operating losses Provisions shall not be recognised for future operating losses (see Example 1 of the appendix to this section). Restructuring A restructuring gives rise to a constructive obligation only when a micro-entity: has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring identifying at least: the business or part of a business concerned; the principal locations affected; the location, function, and approximate number of employees who will be compensated for terminating their services; the expenditures that will be undertaken; and when the plan will be implemented; and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement that plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. A micro-entity recognises a provision for restructuring costs only when it has a legal or constructive obligation at the reporting date to carry out the restructuring. Contingent
