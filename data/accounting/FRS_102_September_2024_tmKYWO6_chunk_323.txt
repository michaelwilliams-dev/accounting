it had always been part of the existing contract. The effect that the contract modification has on the transaction price, and on the entity’s measure of progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, shall be recognised as an adjustment to revenue at the date of the contract modification (ie on a cumulative catch-up basis). If the remaining goods or services are a combination of items (a) and (b), then the entity shall account for the effects of the modification on the unsatisfied (including partially unsatisfied) performance obligations in the modified contract in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of this paragraph. Step 2 – Identify the performance obligations in the contract At contract inception, an entity shall assess the goods and services promised in a contract with a customer and shall identify as a performance obligation each promise to transfer to the customer either: a distinct good or service (or a distinct bundle of goods or services); or a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. A series of distinct goods or services has the same pattern of transfer to the customer if both of the following criteria are met: each distinct good or service in the series that the entity promises to transfer to the customer would meet the criteria in paragraph 23.81 to be a performance obligation satisfied over time; and in accordance with paragraphs 23.98 to 23.104, the same method would be used to measure the entity’s progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation to transfer each distinct good or service in the series to the customer. A contract with a customer generally explicitly states the goods or services that an entity promises to transfer. However, promises may
