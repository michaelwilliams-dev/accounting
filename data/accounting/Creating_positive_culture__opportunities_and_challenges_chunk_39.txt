and values and talk about their culture-related initiatives in more detail. Companies also appear to better understand the relevance of culture to their business model, and we are beginning to see some alignment with strategy and business models. Culture is often a matter for the board as an agenda item within its own right or alternatively considered through lenses of internal audit, risk or people matters. The critical factor is to ensure that these elements are joined up across the organisation. To do this, leaders must show both drive and determination to achieve long-term change. Transforming culture often requires a different approach and skills to those necessary to guide operational change. The 2016 Report urged directors not to wait for a crisis before they focus on culture. It is interesting to see that both this year’s annual reports and the view of contributors to this research cite the pandemic as being instrumental in companies considering wider stakeholder and workforce matters, including employee wellbeing and mental health. They recognise that these issues will impact on both culture and the effectiveness of the company in delivering its strategy. This focus needs to be maintained, as these issues are central to improved trust and transparency, and the need for employees to be able to speak up. This report has re-emphasised the importance of monitoring and assessing culture and we have listed a number of approaches that are being used. The reliance of many companies on staff surveys, site visits and other ad-hoc methods to gain insights into company culture remain a concern. Based on findings contained in this report, the FRC will consider what further action to take, including any amendments to the Guidance.
