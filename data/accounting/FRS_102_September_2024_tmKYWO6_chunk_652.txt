FRS 102 requires donated assets to be valued at their fair value as this reflects that the circumstances described above would rarely occur. In many cases, an entity would be able to sell the donated asset and, if appropriate, purchase a cheaper asset with the equivalent service potential. B34I.3 Incorporating an exception for donated assets that may not be fully exploited would make the application of FRS 102 more onerous, as it would require all entities in receipt of donated assets (except those intended for resale) to consider whether they would be able to exploit the asset fully. This would be subjective and may incur the risk of understatement of the value of donated assets. B34I.4 The FRC noted that when goods are donated for subsequent sale (eg donations to charity shops), it could be argued that the donated goods should be valued only when they are sold. This is not consistent with the accruals concept which requires the financial statements to recognise goods when they are received. However, on pragmatic grounds, FRS 102 requires that when it is impracticable to estimate the value of a resource with sufficient reliability when the resource is received or receivable, the income shall be recognised in the period when the resource is sold or distributed; for example, in the case of high volume, low value second-hand goods donated for resale. Further, the same accounting may be applied by other wholly-owned entities in a public benefit entity group, to eliminate the need to restate goods donated for subsequent sale on consolidation (eg where a charity operates its shops through a subsidiary that is a non-charitable company). B34I.5 FRS 102 requires donated services to be accounted for at their value to the entity. However, FRS 102 expects that contributions made by volunteers cannot be measured
