at present have fewer than 10 PIE audits, with many of them having only one. 2 AFS’s supervision work is directed at UK audit firms. AFS does not currently supervise non-UK firms that audit UK PIEs or the National Audit Office (NAO) and its RIs. These latter entities are required to register with the FRC as PIE audit firms and are subject to formal inspection. We reassess a firm’s tier on an annual basis and inform the firm accordingly, usually in or around April in any calendar year. Where we anticipate that a firm may move up or down a tier, we will aim to discuss this with the firm at the earliest opportunity to help it prepare for a change in status. For example, while our supervision work is approached on a proportionate basis, moving from Tier 3 to Tier 2 will entail more interaction between the firm and the FRC and so require the firm to commit additional resources to engagement with the FRC (albeit significantly less than the requirement on a Tier 1 firm). We seek to avoid a situation where a firm frequently moves between tiers and will take a firm’s longer-term plans into account in our decision-making. How we supervise Tier 2 and Tier 3 firms When a UK firm becomes a PIE audit firm for the first time, we will write to the firm explaining the tier that it has been allocated to (which will usually be Tier 3), drawing attention to key elements of our supervision process and reminding the firm of its ongoing obligations. This first letter will also provide the firm with the names of its allocated supervision team, usually comprising a Supervisor and one other person. We will inform the firm should there be a change in its supervision team
