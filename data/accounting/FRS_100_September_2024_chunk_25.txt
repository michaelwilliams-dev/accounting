In addition, consistency is not required in the following situations: when the parent company does not prepare consolidated accounts; or when some subsidiaries are charities (consistency is not needed between the framework used for these and for other subsidiaries). Where the directors of a parent company prepare IAS group accounts and IAS individual accounts, there only has to be consistency across the individual financial statements of the subsidiaries.
