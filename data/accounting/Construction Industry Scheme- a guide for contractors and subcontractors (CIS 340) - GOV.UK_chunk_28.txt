their employees and CIS deductions from their subcontractors. This should be done monthly (or quarterly, as appropriate) and the calculation should be shown on the company’s EPS.

If the subcontractor does not amend or provide evidence within the set timeframe, HMRC will correct the claim and the subcontractor will be prevented from making further claims in the same tax year. This decision can be appealed — read section 4.22. Contractors must keep a record of the amounts set-oﬀ so they can complete their end- of-year returns.
