An entity shall allocate a discount or variable consideration to all the performance obligations in the contract on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, unless this basis does not depict the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation in the contract. In that case, the entity shall allocate that discount or variable consideration using a method that reflects such an amount (eg a variable payment may be allocated entirely to one performance obligation in the contract if the terms of that variable payment relate specifically to the entity’s efforts to satisfy that performance obligation).
