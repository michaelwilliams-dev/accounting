Another such class of arrangements meet the definition of a lease, but with lease payments significantly below market rates. This might be the case, for example, if the lessor chooses to accept lower rent for the philanthropic intention of providing a benefit to a public benefit entity. A government grant could also be provided in the form of a lease at below-market rates; in this case the lessee may or may not be a public benefit entity. However, other situations which at face value might appear to be ‘below market’ would not indicate a non-exchange component, for example if a lessor discounted the rentals on a retail premises for the primary reason of keeping the premises occupied, regardless of whether or not the lessee was a public benefit entity. B20.16 Section 20 requires a lessee to use the information readily available to it to identify whether a lease contains a non-exchange component. The FRC expects that such situations may not be common in practice. When such a non-exchange component is identified, the lessee is required to account for the incoming resources in accordance with the requirements of Section 34, recognising the income as a contribution to the cost of the right-of-use asset. This represents that, because of the non-exchange component, the value of the right-of-use asset will be higher than the contractual lease payments would imply. Transition requirements B20.17 A lessee applying IFRS 16 for the first time was permitted to make an accounting policy choice between fully-retrospective application or modified retrospective application (with two measurement options). In the interests of simplicity, FRS 102 requires a lessee (both on transition to the new requirements for existing preparers, and for first-time adopters) to apply the modified retrospective approach and set the right-of-use asset equal to the liability (adjusted for any previously-recognised
