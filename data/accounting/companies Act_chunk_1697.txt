must have regard to any representations made in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) in determining whether to revoke the recognition order. If in any case the Secretary of State considers it essential to do so in the public interest he may revoke a recognition order without regard to the restriction imposed by sub- paragraph (2), even if— no notice has been given or published under sub-paragraph (3), or the period of time for making representations in pursuance of such a notice has not expired. An order revoking a recognition order may contain such transitional provision as the Secretary of State thinks necessary or expedient. A recognition order may be revoked at the request or with the consent of the qualifying body and any such revocation is not subject to— the restrictions imposed by sub-paragraphs (1) and (2), or the requirements of sub-paragraphs (3) to (5) and (7). On making an order revoking a recognition order the Secretary of State must— give written notice of the making of the order to the qualifying body, take such steps as he considers reasonably practicable for bringing the making of the order to the attention of persons holding the qualification or in the course of studying for it, and publish a notice of the making of the order in such manner as he thinks appropriate for bringing it to the attention of any other persons who are in his opinion likely to be affected. Transitional provision A recognition order made and not revoked under— paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 12 to the Companies Act 1989 (c. 40), or paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 12 to the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1990 (S.I. 1990/593 (N.I. 5)), before the commencement of this Chapter of this Part of this Act is to have effect after the commencement of this Chapter
