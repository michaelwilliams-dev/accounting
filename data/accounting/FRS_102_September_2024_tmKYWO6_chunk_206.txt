the temporary amendments to specific hedge accounting requirements in paragraphs 12.25C to 12.25F, it shall disclose: that fact; and the significant interest rate benchmarks to which the entity’s hedging relationships are exposed. It shall also consider whether any further disclosure is necessary, for example in accordance with paragraphs 8.6 and 8.7. Appendix to Section 12 Examples of hedge accounting This appendix accompanies, but is not part of, Section 12. It provides guidance for applying the requirements of paragraphs 12.15 and 12.16 to 12.25A. Example 1 Fair value hedge accounting – Hedge of forward foreign currency risk of an unrecognised firm commitment In accordance with paragraph 12.19A, a hedge of the foreign currency risk of an unrecognised firm commitment may be accounted for as a cash flow or fair value hedge. This example illustrates fair value hedge accounting. 12A.1 On 9 June 20X5 an entity enters into a purchase agreement with a third party over a non-financial asset in a foreign currency (FC) for FC515,000. On the same day, the entity enters into a forward currency contract to buy FC500,000 for CU1,000,000. Under the purchase agreement, the non-financial asset will be delivered and paid for on 30 March 20X6, the same day the forward currency contract is required to be settled. In this example the hedged item is the total of the commitment of FC515,000 and the hedging instrument is the forward contract to buy FC500,000. Since the nominal amounts of the two contracts do not match, hedge ineffectiveness arises. It should be noted that in practice an entity could avoid ineffectiveness arising for this reason by identifying an amount of FC500,000 of the total commitment as the hedged item in accordance with paragraph 12.16C. For simplification, this example disregards other sources of ineffectiveness, eg counterparty credit risk associated with the
