For individ uals, the main direct taxes in the UK are income tax and national insurance contributions. Indirect taxes are collected by another party Ð such as a retailer or a prod ucer Ð and then paid to the government . The main indirect taxes in the UK are value added tax (VAT) and excise d uties, charged on alcohol, tobacco, and road fuel. This brieÞng sets out direct tax rates and principal tax allowances for the 2025 /26 tax year. It describes eligibility criteria for these tax allowances and provides a summary of the general tax position in straightforward cases. This brieÞng deals with tax allowances, but not with beneÞts provided under the social security system, child tax credit or working tax credit . Income tax Income tax on earned income is charged at three rates: the basic rate, the higher rate and the additional rate. For 2025 /26 these three rates are 20%, 40% and 45% respectively. No tax is charged on income up to the personal allowance, which is set at £12 , 570 for 2025 /26. The personal allowance has been set at this level since April 202 2 and is d ue to remain there until April 2028. The next £37,700 of income (up to the higher rate threshold, set at £50, 270) is charged tax at the basic rate, set at 20%. Income above the higher rate threshold, up to the additional rate threshold (£125 ,140) is taxed at the 40% rate. Income above £125 ,140 is taxed at the 45% rate. The personal allowance starts to get withdrawn grad ually for earnings above £100,000. Once earnings reach £125 ,140, the personal allowance is completely withdrawn. In other words, the personal allowance is £0. All three tax rates and thresholds are unchanged from 2024 /25 . Personal allowance The personal allowance for income tax is set at £12 , 570 for 2024 /25 . Like the basic rate limit , the personal allowance has been Þxed in value since 2021/2 2 . Marriage allowance Married couples and civil partners may be entitled to claim the marriage allowance. Individ uals whose income is insufÞcient to make full use of their personal allowance can transfer this unused fraction to their spouse or civil partner, up to a set amount . Individ uals cannot make use of this provision if their spouse or partner pays more than the basic rate of tax ( 20%). For 2025 /26 the maximum that can be transferred is £1, 260.
