to do with this publication, and success will mean keeping the challenge-culture issue salient in the minds of auditors, corporate managers, and their boards. Because challenge is not the natural order of business in any organisation; rather, complicity is. And sustaining a culture of challenge thereby requires a continual investment of external energy to resist the entropic forces of organisational complicity. Just as it is helpful to define what success looks like for the FRC’s 2022 Scepticism and Challenge publication, it is useful to identify what failure would look like. In my mind, we can unambiguously conclude that the publication has failed if it results in more hours of process paperwork by rank-and-file auditors, perpetuating the check-the-box malaise that has plagued the audit profession and that is contributing to dissatisfaction, burnout, and exits of early- and mid-career auditors. In the remainder of this commentary, I will remark on the four specific elements identified by the FRC as being critical to auditor scepticism and challenge: employee training, firmwide culture, processes, and ecosystem. Employee training: The BritainThinks focus groups have identified the need for more on-the-job training and more “soft skills” training in the art of challenging clients. This finding gets to the nub of the issue. Audit firms do a reasonably good job training their rank-and-file in the various technical standards and processes that characterise the modern audit. But these deductive skills are only part of what is needed from auditors. Beyond deduction, auditors need to possess skills in critical thinking and judgement. Critical thinking is the basis for professional scepticism, which is the foundation for challenge in audits. And judgement is what finally determines “what matters from the rest” (to quote Isaiah Berlin) when making an audit decision. Neither critical thinking nor judgement can be taught through textbooks and professional-
