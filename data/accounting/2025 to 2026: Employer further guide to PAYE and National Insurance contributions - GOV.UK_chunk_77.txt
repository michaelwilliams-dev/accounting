in total have an annual pay bill of more than £3 million You must report the levy monthly, on the EPS . You must send the EPS to HMRC within 14 days after the end of each tax month. If you run more than one payroll under the same PAY E employer reference, make sure you report the total year to date Þgures for all payrolls operated under the employer scheme. Paying the levy You must pay the levy each month to HMRC, at the same time youÕre due to pay tax and any earnings-related National Insurance contributions, which is within 17 days after the end of the tax month if you pay by an approved method of electronic communication, or within 14 days if youÕre paying by another means. Calculating your levy liability You must calculate the levy each month based on the total cumulative pay bill for your workforce year to date. A 12th of your annual allowance can be used in each month of the tax year on a cumulative basis to o " set against your levy liability. To arrive at the monthly pay bill you must add all the employee earnings subject to Class 1 secondary National Insurance contributions (from each of the paydays in the tax month) together. You must then calculate 0.5% of this amount to calculate your levy liability for that tax month. You then use this Þgure to calculate your cumulative monthly levy liability for the tax year up to that point (for example, 0.5% of each monthÕs pay bill added together). You should then o " set your cumulative monthly allowance against your cumulative monthly levy liability in order to calculate the Apprenticeship Levy payable for each tax month. How the cumulative allowance works £15,000 Ö 12 = £1,250 Month 1 Ñ £1,250 Month 2 Ñ £1,250 + £1,250 = £2,500 Month 3 Ñ £1,250 + £1,250 + £1,250 = £3,750 And so on until month 12 Month 12 Ñ £1,250 + 12 = £15,000 Any unused allowance can be carried over into the following month. But unused allowance in one tax year, cannot be carried over into the next tax year. These are examples of how to calculate the levy liability. Example 1 Ñ regular pay bill of £250,000 each month (£3 million for the tax year so no levy is due) Month 1 £250,000 + 0.5% = £1,250 levy Cumulative levy allowance = £1,250 (for example, £15,000 Ö 12) Levy payable in month 1 = £1,250 Ð £1,250 = NIL Month 2 £500,000 (£250,000 + £250,000) + 0.5% = £2,500 Cumulative levy allowance £2,500 Levy payable to month 2 is NIL Levy paid in month 2 = levy payable to month 2, minus levy paid to month 1 = 0 Ð 0 = 0 And so on until month 12 £3 million (£250,000 + 12) + 0.5% = £15,000 Cumulative levy allowance £15,000 Levy payable to month 12 is NIL Levy paid in month 12 = levy payable to month 12 minus levy paid to month 11 = 0 Ð 0 = 0 Example 2 Ñ regular pay bill of £300,000 each month (£3.6 million for the tax year) Month 1 and each month of the tax year thereafter £300,000 + 0.5% = £1,500 levy Cumulative levy allowance = £1,250 Levy payable in month 1 = £1,500 Ð £1,250 = £250 Month 2 £600,000 (£300,000 + £300,000) + 0.5% = £3,000 Cumulative levy allowance £2,500 Levy payable to month 2 = £3,000 Ð £2,500 = £500 Levy paid in month 2 = levy payable to month 2 minus
