equity holders in their capacity as equity holders. Accordingly, the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest shall be adjusted to reflect the change in the parent’s interest in the subsidiary’s net assets. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is so adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received, if any, shall be recognised directly in equity and attributed to equity holders of the parent. An entity shall not recognise a gain or loss on these changes. Also, an entity shall not recognise any change in the carrying amounts of assets (including goodwill) or liabilities as a result of such transactions. (FRS 102 paragraph 22.19)| There is a significant change in accounting treatment in this situation. Currently under FRS 2, the net assets of the subsidiary are revalued to fair value at the date control is increased and goodwill is recognised at that date, whereas under FRS 102, the net assets are not revalued and no goodwill is recognised; instead the transaction is treated as a transaction with equity holders. Example 1 Company A acquires 70% of Company B for CU120m on 1 January 20X1, when the fair value and book value of its net assets was CU90m. A year later, Company A acquires a further 10% of Company B for CU20m when the carrying amount of Company B’s net assets were CU100m. The fair value of Company B’s net assets at that time was CU170m. FRS 2 1 Jan 20X1 – Acquisition Control has been achieved. The identifiable net assets of the subsidiary are consolidated at fair value of CU90m. Goodwill is recognised as an asset at the date of acquisition amounting to CU57m: |CUm| Cost to acquire 70% holding|120| Company A’s share of identifiable net assets acquired (70% x CU90m)|(63)| Positive goodwill|57|
