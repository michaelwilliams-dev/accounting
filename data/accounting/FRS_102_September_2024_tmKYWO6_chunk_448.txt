has previously been received and recognised in income when, as a result of a subsequent failure to meet restrictions or performance-related conditions attached to it, repayment becomes probable. PBE34.72 [Deleted] Measurement PBE34.73 An entity shall measure incoming resources from non-exchange transactions recognised in accordance with paragraphs PBE34.67 to PBE34.72 as follows: Donated services and facilities shall be measured at the value to the entity. All other incoming resources from non-exchange transactions shall be measured at the fair value of the resources received or receivable. PBE34.73A Value to the entity is the price the entity estimates it would have paid in the open market for a service or facility of equivalent utility to the entity: for example, the amount that the entity would have paid had the service or facility not been donated. This may not be the same as the market value of the service or facility received. For example, if the entity received a premium service but would otherwise only have paid for a standard service, the value to the entity may be the value of a standard service. If an entity would not have purchased the service or facility at all had it not been donated, the value to the entity is expected to be nil. PBE34.73B The fair value of resources received or receivable is usually the price that the entity would have paid on the open market for an identical or comparable resource. Section 2A Fair Value Measurement provides guidance on determining fair value. When there is an absence of evidence of an open market value for an identical or comparable resource, the fair value shall be estimated using another valuation technique. Relevant evidence for use in another valuation technique may include: the cost of the item to the donor; or in the case of goods
