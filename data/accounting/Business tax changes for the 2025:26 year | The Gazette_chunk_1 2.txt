End of tax year changes for businesses To help you make sure you have done all you can to ensure your companyÕs tax affairs are as efficient as they can be, we have identified some of the key themes that business owners should be aware of when it comes to post year-ended changes. National Insurance Contributions (NIC) One of the key tax increases businesses need to plan for is the rise in National Insurance Contributions (NIC) paid by employers in respect of the wages they pay their employees. From 6 April 2025, the NIC rate employers must pay will increase by 1.2%, from 13.8% to 15%. This combines with a change to the point employers start to pay NIC to present a real challenge for many businesses. The threshold where employer NIC contributions become payable will fall from £9,100 to £5,000. Employment Allowance On the flip side, the Employment Allowance , which is available to certain eligible businesses to reduce their employer NIC, will become more generous. Currently, eligible businesses with employer NIC bills of £100,000 or less in the previous tax year may deduct £5,000 from their employer NIC bill, by claiming the allowance. From 6 April, the allowance will rise from £5,000 to £10,500, and the £100,000 eligibility threshold will be removed so eligible employers with employer NICs bills can claim the allowance. The Employment Allowance canÕt be claimed if you are a company with only one employee paid above the Class 1 NIC secondary threshold and that employee is also a director of the company. Certain other restrictions apply to companies making claims so you should seek advice to determine if your business can claim this valuable relief. National Minimum Wage National Living Wage (NLW) and National Minimum Wage (NMW) increases take effect from 1 April 2025: For 21-year-olds and over, NLW will increase to £12.21 per hour (an increase of £0.77) For 18 to 20-year-olds, NMW will increase to £10.00 per hour (an increase of £1.40) For 16 to 17-year-olds, NMW will increase to £7.55 per hour (an increase of £1.15) Businesses must ensure it
