Measuring non-controlling interests: The requirements: to allocate profit or loss and total comprehensive income between non- controlling interest and owners of the parent; for accounting for changes in the parentâ€™s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control; and for accounting for a loss of control over a subsidiary shall be applied prospectively from the date of transition to this FRS (or from such earlier date as this FRS is applied to restate business combinations).

However, if a first-time adopter restates any business combination to comply with FRS 102, it shall restate all later combinations.

If a first-time adopter elects not to apply Section 19 retrospectively, it will still need to apply Section 19 prospectively to any goodwill recognised in its balance sheet at the date of transition. As noted above, the carrying amount of the goodwill would not be adjusted on transition,
