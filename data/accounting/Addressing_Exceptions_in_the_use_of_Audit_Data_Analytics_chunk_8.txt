expectation beforehand, providing the tool with a set of parameters to analyse the population against. In this scenario, auditors would already have obtained evidence over Debtors and Cash through testing of those balances and are thus leveraging the work undertaken on those balances to gain comfort over revenue. The tool may then produce a significant volume of outliers, which on closer examination, comprise a substantial number of transactions which have been paid for via, for example, gift card. Given the initial parameters, the ADA will highlight these as issues for the auditor to investigate, but in reality, people using gift cards to pay for items may well be a normal transaction in the course of business for the audited entity, and there is likely little value in the auditor testing all of those item as exceptions. In this instance, it is likely reasonable for the auditor to go back to their tool, include matching to a Dr in Gift Cards within their population expectation and then re-run the analytical tool in order to identify outliers that merit further investigation as exceptions. This may also necessitate the auditor gathering evidence over the Gift Cards balances if they have not already done so. Once this refinement process is complete, the auditor begins substantive testing of the exceptions, taking account of their firms sampling methodology and the requirements of ISA (UK) 530 Audit Sampling.
