PIE audit portfolios and their impact on the UK public interest, we adopt a scaled, proportionate approach to supervision by dividing the firms we supervise2 into three tiers - Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3. In the following sections we explain in more detail how we allocate a firm’s tier, how we supervise Tier 2 and Tier 3 firms, and what we expect from firms. Tier 4 firms are not subject to any formal supervision or inspection work. How we engage with Tier 4 firms is explained further in section 6. Tier allocation Firms are divided into tiers primarily to reflect their impact on the UK public interest. Tier 1 firms will be those whose audit portfolio has a significant impact, both in terms of the number of PIE audits it conducts and the nature of those audits. Current Tier 1 firms audit, between them, the majority of the FTSE 100 and a significant majority of the FTSE 250, as well as some of the largest banks and insurance entities. While certain Tier 1 firms’ PIE audit portfolios may not be larger than some firms in Tier 2, their inclusion in Tier 1 reflects their presence in sectors of systemic importance (such as banks and major local audits) and other factors such as growth plans and our assessment of risk. Tier 2 firms will be those that do not meet the criteria for Tier 1 but have a significant presence in the PIE audit market, usually at least 10 PIE audits and often more than 20 (meaning that the firm falls within the scope of the AFGC). Our assessment also takes account of risk factors specific to the firm or its audit portfolio. Remaining UK PIE audit firms are allocated into Tier 3. The majority of Tier 3 firms
