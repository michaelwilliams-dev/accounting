Ultimately this may lead to a decision on modifying the audit opinion, including additional material within the auditor’s report, whether to sign the report at all or, in extreme cases, resigning from the engagement. Although the audit opinion is ultimately signed by one person, auditing is a team-based activity. To ensure information is shared effectively, critical views must be aired and shared in a transparent way. To enable more junior members of the audit team to learn, team members need to feel empowered to ask questions and challenge internally. It is incumbent on the audit engagement partner to both seek and deal with internal (and external) challenge. This all enhances the robustness of the audit and develops the team members. Auditors have different obligations when it comes to other information included within the Annual Report. This obligation is explained in detail in ISA (UK) 720 but broadly requires reporting on whether the other information is materially misstated based on the auditor’s knowledge obtained from the audit. The length and breadth of the narrative section of an annual report continues to become more comprehensive and, in addition to a range of qualitative information, includes alternative performance measures. Audit firms consider whether the narrative reporting is “fair, balanced and understandable” and whether it complies with, for entities that are required to follow, the UK Corporate Governance Code and FCA Listing Rules. This sometimes appears to be based on a checklist with insufficient challenge. Whilst this may not be an area of major focus, we do, where necessary, expect auditors to challenge management over whether their narrative reporting meets the criteria of fair, balanced and understandable, and to support the drive for clearer reporting, and not simply tick off a compliance report. To enhance transparency of the audit process, audit teams should also
