B27.6 The indicators of impairment provided in FRS 102 are mainly linked to the expected cash flow from an asset and as such may not necessarily be relevant to some PBE assets; however, they must, as a minimum, be considered by PBEs as possible indicators of impairment. B27.7 In addition, it was noted that other accounting literature (eg IPSAS 21 and SORPs) identified other indicators of impairment including: cessation, or near cessation, of the demand or need for services provided by the asset; social, demographic or environmental changes resulting in a reduction of beneficiaries; and a major loss of key employees associated with particular activities. B27.8 It was concluded that it would not be appropriate to include these indicators in FRS 102, as they are not exclusively relevant to PBEs and because the indicators given in FRS 102 will continue to apply to PBEs. Therefore, their inclusion would make such entities subject to a confusing list of overlapping indicators. B27.9 Consideration was also given to whether FRS 102 should specify that an indicator of impairment was present when an assetâ€™s service potential was not fully utilised. It was noted that an entity may require standby or surplus capacity to ensure that it has adequate capacity to provide services at all times. For example, a building that provides accommodation for the homeless may not be used to full capacity during the summer months but is utilised fully during winter. In this circumstance, the surplus capacity is part of the required service potential of the asset and the asset is not impaired. For this reason, it was concluded that it would be inappropriate to specify that the unutilised capacity should be treated as an indicator of impairment.
