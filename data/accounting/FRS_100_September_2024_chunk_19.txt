in the consolidated financial statements, even when the disclosures are made in aggregate or in an abbreviated form, or, in relation to intra-group balances, when those intra-group balances have been eliminated on consolidation. If, however, no disclosure is made in the consolidated financial statements on the grounds of materiality, the relevant disclosures should be made at the subsidiary level if material in those financial statements. Alternative measurement option for share-based payment transactions AG27 Paragraph 26.16 of FRS 102 permits certain group entities to measure their share-based payment expense on the basis of a reasonable allocation of the expense for the group, provided that that expense has been calculated in accordance with FRS 102, IFRS 2 Share-based Payment or on an equivalent basis. AG28 In deciding whether the share-based payment expense for the group has been calculated on a basis equivalent to FRS 102 or IFRS 2, it is intended that preparers will apply similar considerations to those set out in paragraph AG6. That is, the concept of ‘equivalence’ referred to in this paragraph of FRS 102 is intended to be aligned to that in, for UK entities, section 401 of the Act and, for Irish entities, section 300 of the Companies Act 2014. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether the basis on which the group share-based payment expense has been calculated is in accordance with the basic requirements of the measurement basis of FRS 102 or IFRS 2 (such as the requirement to measure the goods or services received on a fair value basis), without requiring strict conformity with each and every aspect of that basis. This assessment should be based on the particular facts, including the similarities to and differences from the requirements of the relevant standard.
