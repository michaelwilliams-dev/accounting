fair override. It should also be noted, however, that the wording in paragraph 56 of Schedule 1 to the Credit Institutions Regulations 2015 and in paragraph 51 of Schedule 1 to the Insurance Undertakings Regulations 2015 differ to that used in Schedule 3 to the Companies Act 2014, and reference should be made to these paragraphs where applicable. Consequently, for entities applying those regulations, presenting fair value gains or losses attributable to changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 9 will usually require a true and fair override. Stock at fair value A4.9 Paragraph 39 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations permits stocks to be included at their fair value, when applying fair value accounting. Irish company law does not permit stock to be included in the financial statements at fair value. Paragraph 13.5A of FRS 102 states that ‘Where inventories are acquired through a non-exchange transaction, their cost shall be measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition.’ This does not breach the prohibition against fair value accounting as the use of a fair value is a method of estimating cost at initial recognition.
