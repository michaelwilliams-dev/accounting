of assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses are fundamental to recognition, at the end of both annual and interim financial reporting periods. For assets, the same tests of future economic benefits apply at interim dates and at the end of an entityâ€™s financial year. Costs that, by their nature, would not qualify as assets at financial year-end would not qualify at interim dates either. Similarly, a liability at the end of an interim reporting period must represent an existing obligation at that date, just as it must at the end of an annual reporting period. An essential characteristic of income (revenue) and expenses is that the related inflows and outflows of assets and liabilities have already taken place. If those inflows or outflows have taken place, the related revenue and expense are recognised; otherwise they are not recognised. Section 2 of FRS 102 does not allow the recognition of items in the statement of financial position which do not meet the definition of assets or liabilities, however in some cases this may be inconsistent with the requirements of another section of FRS 102, which takes precedence. In measuring the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses, and cash flows reported in its financial statements, an entity that reports only annually is able to take into account information that becomes available throughout the financial year. Its measurements are, in effect, on a year-to-date basis. An entity uses information available when the interim financial report is being prepared. Amounts of income and expenses reported in the current interim period will reflect any changes in estimates of amounts reported in the last published financial statements. The amounts reported in the last published financial statements, whether at the end of a prior interim period or at the end of the prior financial year, are not retrospectively
