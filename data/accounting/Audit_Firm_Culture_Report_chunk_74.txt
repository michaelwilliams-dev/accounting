If you go for a new client, if they answer that you got a bad quality score, it shortens your career or inhibits you.” (Partner) What’s working less well Increased and unclear documentation demands Many senior auditors and partners across firms felt demands around documenting scepticism and challenge from the FRC are increasing, in some cases unsustainably, impacting their ability to effectively exercise these behaviours.
