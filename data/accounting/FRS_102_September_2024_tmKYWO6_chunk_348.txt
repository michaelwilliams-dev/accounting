in its effort to obtain a contract with a customer. An entity may recognise such costs as an asset if: the costs would not have been incurred by the entity if the contract had not been obtained (eg a sales commission payable on obtaining a contract); and the costs are expected to be recovered. If an entity adopts a policy of recognising costs to obtain a contract that meet the criteria in paragraph 23.113 as an asset, that policy shall be applied consistently to all costs that meet the criteria of paragraph 23.113, except for costs that the entity would recognise as an asset with an amortisation period of one year or less, which may be expensed when incurred. Costs that do not meet the criteria in paragraph 23.113 are recognised as an expense when incurred. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs 23.113 and 23.114, costs to obtain a contract that would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained shall be recognised as an asset if those costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer regardless of whether the contract is obtained. Costs of fulfilling a contract An entity shall account for the costs incurred in fulfilling a contract with a customer in accordance with the relevant section of this FRS for those costs (eg Section 13 Inventories, Section 17 Property, Plant and Equipment, or Section 18 Intangible Assets other than Goodwill). If the costs incurred in fulfilling a contract are not within the scope of another section of this FRS, an entity shall recognise those costs as an asset if: the costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that the entity can specifically identify; the costs generate or enhance resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy)
