experience and expertise, help mitigate the risk of biases and provide the opportunity to coach more junior or less experienced members of the team in how to effectively exercise professional judgement. It is important that audit teams encourage a healthy culture of debate and challenge to ensure that established professional hierarchies or seniority of certain team members do not hinder the exercise of objectivity and scepticism by everyone on the team. Consultation outside the engagement team, such as with an external expert or an engagement quality reviewer, can further widen the pool of expertise available to those making the judgement, which can offer a valuable additional source of information. Example The audit team is working on the audit of G plc, and has identified potential impairment indicators around an investment property held by the group. There is significant professional judgement needed here, and the engagement partner initially frames the judgement as being an assessment of whether the property balance should be impaired, with a subsequent simple calculation of whether the misstatement, if there is one, is greater than materiality. The partner recognises the significance of the judgement and discusses it with the engagement quality reviewer (EQR). The EQR points out that the issue could affect the segmental information presented by the group, and in particular that a misstatement smaller than group materiality could affect the profitability of a segment that the market has identified as playing a significant role in the groupâ€™s operations. Therefore, a misstatement lower than group materiality could potentially be expected to influence the economic decisions of users, and thus be material. This causes the engagement partner to reframe the judgement as including a more considered assessment of whether any potential misstatement is material (whether quantitively or qualitatively), and also whether materiality has been set at an
