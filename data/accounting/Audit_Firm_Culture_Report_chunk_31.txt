These types of meetings in particular were felt to make professional scepticism and challenge a collaborative process, as both junior and senior colleagues can come together and discuss any issues they are seeing during the engagement, providing a useful forum for discussion, learnings and to establish what management may need to be challenged on. They were also seen as building junior auditors’ confidence around these behaviours in a relatively ‘safe space’. “[Scepticism and challenge] feels most natural when it’s clear who is looking most closely at each of the biggest risk areas (during an engagement) … Nothing falls through and internal meetings are more focussed.” (Assistant manager / Manager) Partners modelling positive behaviours Auditors at all levels were positive that challenge is generally being encouraged by senior auditors setting the right examples. In particular, it is noticed that some senior auditors and auditor managers make a point to invite junior colleagues to attend meetings with Audit Committees or the audited entity purely to observe, taking time to
