harvest; increases resulting from business combinations; and other changes. This reconciliation need not be presented for prior periods. A If an entity measures any individual biological assets at cost in accordance with paragraph 34.6A, it shall explain why fair value cannot be reliably measured. If the fair value of such a biological asset becomes reliably measurable during the current period an entity shall explain why fair value has become reliably measurable and the effect of the change. B An entity shall disclose the methods and significant assumptions applied in determining the fair value at the point of harvest of each class of agricultural produce. Measurement – cost model An entity applying the cost model shall measure biological assets at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. In applying the cost model, agricultural produce harvested from an entity’s biological assets shall be measured at the point of harvest at either: the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell; or its fair value less costs to sell. Any gain or loss arising on initial recognition of agricultural produce at fair value less costs to sell shall be included in profit or loss for the period in which it arises. Such measurement becomes the cost at that date for the purposes of applying Section 13 or another applicable section of this FRS. Elements of cost A The cost of a biological asset comprises all of the following: Its purchase price, including legal and brokerage fees, import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates. Any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The initial estimate of the costs, recognised and measured in
