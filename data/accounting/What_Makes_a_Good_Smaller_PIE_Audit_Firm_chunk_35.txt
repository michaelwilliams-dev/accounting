this section we provide an overview of our investigation process, focusing on the AEP, and draw out key points in relation to how a firm may prepare for an investigation and what we expect from firms during the process. Investigations Once the FRC’s Conduct Committee has decided that an investigation should be opened, a Notice of Investigation will be sent to the subjects of the investigation (usually the firm but individuals such as the RI may also be investigation subjects). A copy is also sent to the relevant RSB(s). The case is referred to the FRC’s Enforcement Division, which will set up a case team typically comprising one or two lawyers, one or two forensic accountants and a legal assistant. How the investigation will proceed One of the first actions the case team will take is to schedule a scoping meeting with the firm. The primary purpose of this meeting is to introduce the case team, provide high-level information about the scope and initial focus of the investigation, outline how the investigation will proceed and set out the expectations of the firm and individuals during the investigation. The case team will also issue one or more Notices requiring the firm to provide relevant documents and information. 4 The FRC operates separate enforcement schemes relating to Local Audit, audits conducted by the NAO and audits of Crown Dependency entities. Further details may be found on our website. We commonly request the following items: The relevant audit file(s) (including any review notes) both (a) on a laptop or Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, and (b) in a format that may be uploaded to our e-discovery platform. Details of any related files or documents other than those located on the audit file(s), including handwritten notes and workbooks. Details of the audit engagement partner (RI), EQCR
