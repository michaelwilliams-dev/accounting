the amount capitalised would be CU300. During 2018 Entity E completed construction of the building. The total cost to be capitalised in accordance with FRS 102 (excluding borrowing costs) is CU90,000. Qualifying borrowing costs calculated in accordance with FRS 102 relating to the project as a whole are CU2,500, including the CU300 from 2017. On transition to FRS 102, Entity E reviews its accounting policies and decides that it will now elect to capitalise borrowing costs in accordance with Section 25, and in accordance with paragraph 35.1(o) it elects to capitalise costs prospectively from 1 January 2018. As a result, no adjustment is made to the carrying value of the asset at the date of transition (ie 1 January 2018); the CU300 previously written off is not capitalised, but CU2,200 of borrowing costs are capitalised during the year ended 31 December 2018.
