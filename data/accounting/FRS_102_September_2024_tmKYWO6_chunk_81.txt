activities, or to allow another party to deploy the economic resource in that other party’s activities. Definition of a liability For a liability to exist, three criteria must all be satisfied: the entity has an obligation; the obligation is to transfer an economic resource; and the obligation is a present obligation that exists as a result of past events. An obligation is a duty or responsibility that an entity has no practical ability to avoid. An obligation is always owed to another party (or parties). It is not necessary to know the identity of the party (or parties) to whom the obligation is owed. Many obligations are established by contract, legislation or similar means and are legally enforceable by the party (or parties) to whom they are owed. Obligations can also arise, however, from an entity’s customary practices, published policies or specific statements if the entity has no practical ability to act in a manner inconsistent with those practices, policies or statements. The obligation that arises in such situations is sometimes referred to as a constructive obligation. To satisfy the criterion in paragraph 2.38(b), the obligation must have the potential to require the entity to transfer an economic resource to another party (or parties). For that potential to exist, it does not need to be certain, or even likely, that the entity will be required to transfer an economic resource – the transfer may, for example, be required only if a specified uncertain future event occurs. It is only necessary that the obligation already exists and that, in at least one circumstance, it would require the entity to transfer an economic resource. Obligations to transfer an economic resource include, for example: obligations to pay cash; obligations to deliver goods or provide services; obligations to exchange economic resources with another party
