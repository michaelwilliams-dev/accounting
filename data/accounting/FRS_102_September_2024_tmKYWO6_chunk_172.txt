of the issuer is recognised in profit or loss only when: the entityâ€™s right to receive payment is established; it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity; and the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably. Amortised cost and effective interest method The amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability at each reporting date is the net of the following amounts: the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition; minus any repayments of the principal; plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between the amount at initial recognition and the maturity amount; minus, in the case of a financial asset, any reduction (directly or through the use of an allowance account) for impairment or uncollectability. Financial assets and financial liabilities that have no stated interest rate (and do not constitute a financing transaction) and are classified as payable or receivable within one year are initially measured at an undiscounted amount in accordance with paragraph 11.14(a). Therefore, (c) above does not apply to them. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability (or a group of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. The effective interest rate is determined on the basis of the carrying amount of the financial asset or liability at initial recognition. Under the effective interest method: the amortised
