this disclosure. The team find that some companies do provide such information, for example disclosing the average net debt for the year. She consults with an internal technical panel of partners who have greater experience in how the intended users of F plc’s financial statements might interpret and use the relevant disclosure. They advise that net debt levels and capital structure ratios do indeed commonly influence investment decisions in this sector, and that there is diversity regarding the extent to which investors take the time to look at other balance sheet metrics with similar interest. The engagement partner notes that the change in net debt at year end is many times materiality, so if she decides that the disclosure is misstated, it is likely materially misstated. FRC | Professional Judgement Guidance 8 The engagement partner weighs the various alternative conclusions against how well they allow her to meet her objectives for the judgement. Having gathered and analysed a range of information, the engagement partner sees the judgement as coming down to two main considerations, reflecting the two ways she identified that the disclosure could be potentially misleading. Firstly, whether the intended users would understand from what is disclosed that the low level of net debt is likely transient and, secondly, whether the context that the net debt figure is shown in makes it appear as though the company’s capital management policy includes keeping net debt at broadly the year end level. This illustrative example does not contain sufficient detail for the engagement partner’s conclusion to be clear. Irrespective of how she concludes, the engagement partner will ensure that the issue is soundly documented on the audit file. Reflecting on the judgement, the engagement partner notes that issues have arisen during the judgement process that may trigger further professional judgement processes.
