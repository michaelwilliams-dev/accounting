capitalisation, finance costs that could have been capitalised amounted to CU300. During 2014 Entity E completed construction of the building. The total cost to be capitalised in accordance with FRS 102 (excluding borrowing costs) is CU90,000. Qualifying borrowing costs calculated in accordance with FRS 102 relating to the project as a whole are CU2,500.
