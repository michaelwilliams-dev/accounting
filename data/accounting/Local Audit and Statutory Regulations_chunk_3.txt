monitoring for audits of significant local public bodies. The Audit Quality Review team of the FRC will have responsibility for monitoring the quality of what are to be termed “major local audits”. The monitoring of the audits of local bodies which transitioned into the new regime on 1 April 2017 commenced in 2018 in respect of financial years ending 31 March 2018. The FRC will also operate an enforcement procedure for major local audits undertaken in the new regime. FRC Statutory Regulations The Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 (LAAA) introduces new arrangements for regulating the auditors of local bodies in England. As a part of that statutory framework there is a delegation of powers and responsibilities to the FRC under the Local Audit (Delegation of Functions) and Statutory Audit (Delegation of Functions) Order 2014. The FRC has been delegated three specific responsibilities and has made three legal instruments under those powers.
