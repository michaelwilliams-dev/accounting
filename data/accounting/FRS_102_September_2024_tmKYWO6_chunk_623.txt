no commercial substance or the entity has created a valid expectation that it would settle in cash.

It was noted that this requirement is different to EU-adopted IFRS which requires the separate recognition of debt and equity components. The simpler requirements of FRS 102 provide a practical and proportionate solution for those applying the standard and are generally consistent with the requirements of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. The exemption from cash-settled accounting when the option to settle in cash has no commercial substance was retained in FRS 102.
