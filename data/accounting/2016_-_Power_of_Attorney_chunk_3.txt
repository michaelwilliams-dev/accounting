Holdings in a trustee capacity may be prohibited even when the individual acting in that capacity has no existing beneficial interests in the assets over which they have control, for example where: the holder of the Power of Attorney may be an ultimate beneficiary of the ‘living estate’/ trust; or the financial interest in an entity was material to the ‘living estate’/ trust overall; or the holder of a Power of Attorney, is able to exert significant influence over an entity or an affiliate of that entity; or the holder of the Power of Attorney has significant influence over the way in which those assets are invested. The Ethical Standard states that in respect of the matters covered in paragraphs ES 2.3-2.5 threats cannot be eliminated or reduced by other safeguards to a level where they would not compromise independence (ES 2.6). As the requirements in ES 2.3 are applicable to all partners in the audit firm, they cannot be addressed by removing a partner from an engagement or area of activity. Should, therefore, prohibited financial interests controlled under a Power of Attorney by a partner or a closely associated person of a partner, in an entity subject to an audit or other public interest assurance engagement by a firm, not be disposed of this would result in a breach of the Ethical Standard. Where financial interests are divested this should take place as soon as possible after the individual controlling them under a Power of Attorney becomes able to make a disposal. Audit firms should also consider their policies and procedures which make up their control environment to ensure that they adequately cover financial interests held under a Power of Attorney. 2
