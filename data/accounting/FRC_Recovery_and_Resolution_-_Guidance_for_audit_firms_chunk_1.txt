This should be reflected in a Recovery and Resolution Plan. We acknowledge that larger firms are likely to have separate, but linked, Business Continuity, Recovery, and Resolution plans, whereas in smaller firms these may be combined in a single plan. Effective recovery planning enables firms to consider in advance threats to their existence and strategies to manage such situations operationally, financially, legally, reputationally, and regulatorily. Effective recovery planning can also mitigate the risk of failure and, if failure occurs, effective resolution planning can reduce the impact and likelihood of a disorderly exit from the market. In early 2020, we provided guidance on what firms should have in place as a minimum (i.e. minimum standards), and additionally good practice, in relation to Recovery and Resolution Planning to assist firms in benchmarking their own approaches. Given the ongoing risk of failure, we have refreshed our guidance as set out below.
