of 2%. The condition in paragraph 11.9(b) is therefore also met.| 4A|A loan with a condition that the interest rate is reset to a higher rate if a set number of payments is missed In this case the change in interest rate is contingent on a set number of payments being missed. The missed payments are an indicator of credit deterioration of the issuer. The interest rate reset condition therefore meets the condition in paragraph 11.9(aB)(i)(2) (provided the new rate meets the conditions in paragraph 11.9(a)), and the interest rate reset condition would not result in the loan being measured at fair value in accordance with Section 12.| 5|Interest on a loan is referenced to 2 times the bank’s standard variable rate In accordance with the definition of a variable rate, the contractual interest rate payable can be linked to a single observable interest rate. A bank’s standard variable rate is an observable rate and meets the definition of a variable rate, but the rate in this example is 2 times the bank’s standard variable rate and therefore the link to the observable interest rate is leveraged. As a result of the leverage, the rate in this example is not a variable rate as described in paragraph 11.9(a). A leveraged link to an observable interest rate is also inconsistent with the description in paragraph 11.9A because it increases the variability of cash flows so that they do not represent reasonable compensation for the time value of money, credit risk or other basic lending risks and costs. The instrument is measured at fair value in accordance with Section 12.| 6|Interest on a loan is charged at 10% less 6-month interbank offered rate (IBOR) over the life of the loan The effect of deducting a variable rate from a positive fixed rate
