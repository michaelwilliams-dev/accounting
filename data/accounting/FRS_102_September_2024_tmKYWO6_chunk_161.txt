cash flows on specified dates that constitute repayment of the principal advanced, together with reasonable compensation for the time value of money, credit risk and other basic lending risks and costs (eg liquidity risk, administrative costs associated with holding the instrument and lender’s profit margin). Contractual terms that introduce exposure to unrelated risks or volatility (eg changes in equity prices or commodity prices) are inconsistent with this. Examples – Debt instruments| 1|A zero-coupon loan For a zero-coupon loan, the holder’s return is the difference between the nominal value of the loan and the issue price. The holder (lender) receives a fixed amount when the loan matures and the issuer (borrower) repays the loan. The return to the holder meets the condition in paragraph 11.9(a)(i).| 2|A fixed interest rate loan with an initial tie-in period which reverts to the bank’s standard variable interest rate after the tie-in period The initial fixed rate is a return permitted by paragraph 11.9(a)(ii). A bank’s standard variable interest rate is an observable interest rate and, in accordance with the definition of a variable rate, is a permissible link and so meets the condition in paragraph 11.9(a)(ii). The variation of the interest rate after the tie-in period is non-contingent and, since the new rate (ie the bank’s standard variable rate) meets the conditions in paragraph 11.9(a), the conditions in paragraph 11.9(aB)(i) are met.| 3|A loan with interest payable at the bank’s standard variable rate plus 1% throughout the life of the loan As discussed in Example 2 above, a bank’s standard variable rate is a permitted variable rate in accordance with the definition of variable rate. The combination of a positive fixed rate (ie plus 1%) and a positive variable rate is a permitted return under paragraph 11.9(a)(iv). The combination of a bank’s standard variable rate
