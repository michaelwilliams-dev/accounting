held as part of a trading portfolio, that are derivatives or when permitted by UK-adopted international accounting standards. B11.22 For example, the original text of FRS 102 would have required certain financial liabilities, where the cash outflows are linked to non-financial variables specific to one party to the contract, to be classified as other and measured at fair value. Fair value measurement is not permitted for such liabilities under UK-adopted international accounting standards and so would be prohibited by the Regulations. B11.23 The FRC was aware that there were divergent views on what constitutes a ‘non-financial variable’ in other cases. For example, there is no clear consensus on whether measures of performance such as turnover, profits or EBITDA are ‘non-financial variables … specific to a party to the contract’. The FRC was unable to resolve this divergence as to do so would involve interpreting UK-adopted international accounting standards on an issue that the IFRS Interpretations Committee had so far not reached a definitive conclusion on. B11.24 Similarly, FRS 102 would have required financial assets that are similarly linked to non-financial variables specific to one party to the contract, to be classified as other and measured at fair value through profit or loss. Although the Regulations permit financial assets to be measured at fair value, this measurement is only available as permitted by UK-adopted international accounting standards, which in some cases is restricted to fair value through other comprehensive income. B11.25 The FRC also noted that there may be other non-basic financial assets and liabilities that UK-adopted international accounting standards, and hence the Regulations, would not permit to be measured at fair value through profit or loss although it expected that such instruments would be rare in practice. B11.26 As a result, an exception is included in paragraph 12.8(c) in respect
