that audit PIEs and we have engaged most intensively with firms that have a significant presence in the PIE audit market, our Tier 1 firms, with less intensive supervision for firms in Tier 2 and Tier 3. We recognise that it is important to have a pipeline of firms that are equipped to enter the PIE audit market and conduct a high-quality audit from the start. We have therefore created a Tier 4 for firms that are not yet PIE auditors but are seeking to enter the PIE audit market. We plan to engage with these firms through inviting them to participate in briefings, roundtables and other events run by the FRC. Tier 4 firms will also be able to apply to participate in our new Scalebox initiative. Audit Firm Scalebox The objectives of the Scalebox include: Improving audit quality at Tier 2 firms, Tier 3 firms and firms contemplating taking on the statutory audit of PIEs or other entities or audits within the FRC’s scope, including major local audits. Promoting resilience in relevant sectors of the audit market. Supporting the FRC’s role as an Improvement Regulator. Enhancing the FRC’s ability to fulfil its regulatory objectives. The Scalebox will operate separately to the FRC’s formal supervision and Inspection work and will work with individual firms to help them understand how to improve and grow. The Scalebox will also work with firms to help them understand in more detail the FRC’s regulatory expectations and our approach to supervision and inspection.
