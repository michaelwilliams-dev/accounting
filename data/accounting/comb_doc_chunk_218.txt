the cash selling price of CU900 in accordance with paragraph 11.13 of FRS 102. The customer records the following accounting entries when the piece of machinery is purchased: Dr Property, plant and equipment CU900 Cr Trade payable CU900 After initial recognition the customer accounts for the trade payable at amortised cost using the effective interest method as demonstrated in Example 6 below. Fixed term loans with no interest or a below market rate of interest A loan provided or received at no or a below market rate of interest constitutes a financing transaction. Paragraph 11.13 of FRS 102 requires that such a loan is measured at the present value of the future cash receipts or payments discounted at a market rate of interest of a similar financial asset or financial liability. The present value calculated in accordance with paragraph 11.13 of FRS 102 reflects the value of a similar loan with a market rate of interest. For loans other than those repayable on demand, a difference arises between the amount of cash received or advanced and the present value of the loan. This difference reflects that the lender has made a loan at a lower than market rate of interest and thereby has provided an additional benefit to the borrower. FRS 102 does not set out specific accounting requirements for that difference. Where FRS 102 does not specifically address the accounting for a transaction, an entity applies judgement to determine the accounting treatment that meets the requirements of paragraph 10.4 of FRS 102, ie an entity selects an accounting policy that results in relevant and reliable information. Paragraph 10.5 sets out the sources an entity should consider for that analysis. To determine the accounting treatment for the difference, an entity should assess the particular facts and circumstances of each arrangement.
