and shall apply it to all of its leases. In this case, a lessee may rely on its previous assessment of whether right-of-use assets are impaired at the date of transition to this FRS, rather than applying Section 27 at that date. A lessee not applying the IFRS 16 election described above shall measure the lease liability at the date of transition to this FRS at the present value of remaining lease payments, discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate or the lessee’s obtainable borrowing rate for each lease at the date of transition to this FRS. The right-of-use asset shall be measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments. Notwithstanding the previous items in this paragraph, a lessee shall measure a right-of-use asset that meets the definition of investment property, and will not be transferred to right-of-use assets using the election in paragraph 16.4A(b)(ii), at fair value on the date of transition to this FRS. A lessee may do one or more of the following at the date of transition to this FRS, applied on a lease-by-lease basis: Apply a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics (for example, a similar remaining lease term for a similar class of underlying asset in a similar economic environment). Choose not to recognise a lease liability and right-of-use asset for leases for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the date of transition to this FRS, or leases for which the underlying asset is of low value (as described in paragraph 20.5). Instead, the entity shall account for (including disclosure of information about) these leases as if they were short-term leases accounted for in accordance with paragraph 20.6. Use hindsight, such as in
