of the lease term, a lessee shall recognise its rights of use and obligations under finance leases as assets and liabilities … at amounts equal to the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, determined at the inception of the lease. (FRS 102 paragraph 20.9) The present value of the minimum lease payments should be calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If this cannot be determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate shall be used.

(FRS 102 paragraph 20.8)| FRS 102 requires finance leases to be recognised at amounts equal to the fair value of the leased asset, or if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. In contrast, SSAP 21 requires measurement at the present value of the minimum lease payments, but as a practical expedient permits the use of the fair value of the asset (where it is a sufficiently close approximation). On application of FRS 102, entities may need to consider the measurement of finance
