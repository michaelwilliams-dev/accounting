Regulations 2016 (Satcar). Introduction This document is aimed at firms that plan to enter the PIE audit market, or currently have a small PIE audit portfolio. It provides: An overview of what we expect firms to focus on to ensure that their audit practice is capable of performing high-quality audits. This includes insights from our supervision of audit firms and areas for firms to focus on as they grow - both in terms of what they should do and things to avoid doing (section 2). A guide to how the FRC regulates PIE audit firms covering: What firms need to do to register with the FRC as a PIE auditor and their ongoing obligations (section 3). Registering with the FRC is the first step that a firm must take before it becomes the statutory auditor of any PIEs. What to expect from supervision and inspection by the FRC, including how our inspections of a firm’s audits or its quality monitoring system may differ from the approach taken by a firm’s Recognised Supervisory Body (RSB) (section 4). How the FRC’s Enforcement process works, and how to manage some of the challenges an investigation may bring (section 5). New initiatives from the FRC to provide more support to firms, including our new Tier 4 and the Audit Firm Scalebox (section 6). While the focus of this document is on PIE audits, the FRC expects high-quality standards to be applied to all audits. These should be underpinned by a robust system of quality management developed in accordance with International Standard on Quality Management (UK) 1 (ISQM 1) and in compliance with the ethical standards (currently the Revised Ethical Standard 2019). Nothing in this document should be interpreted as suggesting that it is acceptable for quality standards to vary between PIE and non-PIE audits
