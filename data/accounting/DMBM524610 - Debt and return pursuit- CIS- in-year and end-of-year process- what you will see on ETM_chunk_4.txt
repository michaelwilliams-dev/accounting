ETMP allows additional time for the return to be processed and does not raise the CIS specified charge until ten days after all other specified charges are created. Specified charges are not created if either: any of the following signals are sent by CISR: Logged Exempt Inactive the CIS scheme start date is moved back from the original start date and we do not have CIS returns for those return periods. If the contractor submits the outstanding CIS return or a quantification takes place, the CIS specified charge is ‘reversed’ and a new In Year CISR charge is created for the return/quantified amount. If the contractor submits a nil CIS return, the relevant CIS specified charge will be reversed. A nil CIS charge is not created. CIS specified charges are also reversed if the exemption signal is subsequently received from CISR. CIS specified charges are legally enforceable under Regulation 16 of the Income Tax (Construction Industry Scheme) Regulations 2005. Is this page useful?
