The audited entity has made a number of complex acquisitions in the year, and the senior manager is required by auditing standards to ensure that the engagement team has the skills to effectively apply professional scepticism and challenge management in this area. He identifies the need for experienced auditors to enhance the team, but does not specify that they require relevant sector experience. The firm provides experienced auditors, but at the same time re-deploys some less experienced junior team members who nevertheless have direct knowledge of the audited entity. The experience of the new engagement team members is generic rather than specific to complex acquisitions, and the loss of team members with direct knowledge of the audited entity, further undermines the ability of the audit team to apply professional judgement, scepticism and challenge of management. The issues here may have been avoided if the senior manager had more clearly articulated their objectives when deciding how best to resource the team. He focused on seniority as a proxy for expertise in the relevant subject matter. While imperfect proxies such as this may sometimes be useful and necessary, they can lead to problems if objectives are framed entirely in terms of the proxy metric. If the senior manager had set an objective of the engagement team having sufficient technical skill in the relevant areas, for example, he may have ensured that appropriate skills and knowledge were retained by the team. Poor objective setting can affect other parts of the framing step, including obscuring viable alternatives. For example, an objective cast in terms of relevant expertise within the engagement team may have led
