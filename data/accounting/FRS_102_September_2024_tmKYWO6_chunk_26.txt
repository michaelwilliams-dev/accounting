for completed contracts that have variable consideration, an entity may use the transaction price at the date the contract was completed rather than estimating variable consideration amounts in the comparative reporting periods. for contracts that were modified before the date of initial application, an entity need not retrospectively restate the contract for those contract modifications in accordance with paragraphs 23.15 to 23.16. Instead, an entity may reflect the aggregate effect of all of the modifications that occurred before the beginning of the earliest period presented or before the date of initial application when: identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations; determining the transaction price; and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations. for prior periods presented, an entity need not disclose the information required by paragraph 23.137. For any of the practical expedients in paragraph 1.65 that an entity uses, the entity shall apply that expedient consistently to all contracts and periods presented. If an entity applies any of the expedients in paragraph 1.65, it shall disclose that fact. In paragraphs 1.62 and 1.65, a completed contract is a contract for which the entity has transferred all the goods or services identified in accordance with previous requirements for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers, which the revised Section 23 replaced.

If an entity selects this transition approach, it shall not restate comparative information. Instead, the entity shall recognise the cumulative effect of initially applying paragraphs 29.17A to 29.17C as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings
