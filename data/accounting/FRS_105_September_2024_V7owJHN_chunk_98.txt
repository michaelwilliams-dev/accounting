the micro-entity’s performance in transferring control of goods or services promised to a customer (ie the satisfaction of the performance obligation). A micro-entity shall apply a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time and shall apply that method consistently to similar performance obligations and in similar circumstances. At the end of each reporting period, a micro-entity shall remeasure its progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation satisfied over time and update its measure of progress. Such changes to a micro-entity’s measure of progress shall be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with paragraphs 8.10B to 8.13. In determining a method of measuring progress, a micro-entity shall consider the nature of the good or service that the micro-entity will transfer to the customer. Appropriate methods of measuring progress include methods that recognise revenue based on: measurements of the value to the customer of the goods or services transferred to date relative to the remaining goods or services to be transferred under the contract (referred to as output methods); and the micro-entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation relative to the total expected inputs to satisfy the performance obligation (referred to as input methods). If a micro-entity has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the micro-entity’s work to date (eg a service contract in which a micro-entity bills a fixed amount for each hour of service provided), the micro-entity shall recognise revenue in the amount to which the micro-entity has a right to invoice. If a micro-entity cannot reasonably measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation (eg in the early stages of a contract), but the micro-entity expects to recover the
