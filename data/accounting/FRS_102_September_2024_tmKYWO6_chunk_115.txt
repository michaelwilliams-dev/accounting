in amount. Similarly, it would be inappropriate to exclude items on the grounds that they do not involve cash flows, such as depreciation and amortisation expenses. Profits or losses on the disposal of a discontinued operation shall be excluded from operating profit. Ordinary activities and extraordinary items An entity applying paragraph 5.5(a), 5.5(d), 5.7(a) or 5.7(d) shall not present or describe any items of income or expense as ‘extraordinary items’ in the statement of comprehensive income (or in the income statement, if presented) or in the notes. Paragraphs 5.10A and 5.10B apply to entities applying paragraphs 5.5(b), 5.5(c), 5.7(b) or 5.7(c). A Ordinary activities are any activities which are undertaken by a reporting entity as part of its business and such related activities in which the reporting entity engages in furtherance of, incidental to, or arising from, these activities. Ordinary activities include any effects on the reporting entity of any event in the various environments in which it operates, including the political, regulatory, economic and geographical environments, irrespective of the frequency or unusual nature of the events. B Extraordinary items are material items possessing a high degree of abnormality which arise from events or transactions that fall outside the ordinary activities of the reporting entity and which are not expected to recur. The additional line items required to be presented by paragraph 5.9 and material items required to be disclosed by paragraph 5.9A, are not extraordinary items when they arise from the ordinary activities of the entity. Extraordinary items do not include prior period items merely because they relate to a prior period.
