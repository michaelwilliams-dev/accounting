reliable estimate of fair value if there has been a significant change in economic circumstances or a significant period of time between the date of the transaction, and the measurement date. If neither (a) nor (b) above are available or reliable, the fair value shall be estimated using another valuation technique. The objective of using another valuation technique is to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell an asset or to transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date. 2A.16 An entity shall use valuation techniques consistent with one or more of these approaches: the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities or a group of assets and liabilities, such as a business. the cost approach reflects the amount that would be required currently to replace the service capacity of an asset (often referred to as current replacement cost). the income approach reflects expectations of future performance (eg cash flows or income and expenses). Valuation techniques using the income approach include present value techniques, option pricing models, and the multi-period excess earnings method. 2A.17 Valuation techniques used to measure fair value shall be applied consistently. However, a change in a valuation technique or its application is appropriate if the change results in a measurement that is equally or more representative of fair value in the circumstances. This may be the case, for example, if new markets develop or new information becomes available. Revisions resulting from such a change in the valuation technique used or in its application shall be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with paragraphs 10.14D to 10.17. However, an entity need not provide the disclosures required by paragraph 10.18. 2A.18 If an asset or
