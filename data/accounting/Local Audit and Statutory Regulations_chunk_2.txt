external auditors. FRC Responsibilities The Government laid an Order before Parliament on 16 June 2014 that delegated to the FRC most of its responsibilities for oversight of the regulation of auditors of local public bodies by the RSBs (The Local Audit (Delegation of Functions) and Statutory Audit (Delegation of Functions) Order 2014). These powers formally took effect on 19 August 2014. The FRC has been delegated three specific responsibilities under the Order: make regulations on the reports, known as transparency reports, which the 2014 Act requires auditors of major local bodies to publish each year; make regulations about the keeping of the Register of Local Public Auditors; give statutory guidance to the RSBs on the level of competence and experience required for the approval of those individuals within a local public audit firm that are able to take responsibility for an audit and sign an audit opinion on behalf of the firm. The FRC has revised its guidance following a public consultation. Recognised Supervisory Bodies (RSB) and Recognised Qualifying Bodies (RQB) The FRC is also responsible for recognising bodies as RSBs and RQBs for local audit purposes. ICAEW has been recognised as a RSB for local audit since 1 November 2015 and CIPFA as a RQB since 1 October 2014. ICAS was recognised as a RSB for local audit from 1 November 2015 until 31 December 2020 after which ICAS ceased to hold RSB status for Local Audit in England. The requirements for recognition under the LAAA generally mirror the requirements under the Companies Act 2006. The Professional Bodies Supervision Team of the FRC is responsible for the oversight of the activities of the RSBs and the RQB to ensure they continue to meet the requirements for recognition.
