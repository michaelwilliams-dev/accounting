Where— on the revaluation of a fixed asset, an unrealised profit is shown to have been made, and on or after the revaluation, a sum is written off or retained for depreciation of that asset over a period, an amount equal to the amount by which that sum exceeds the sum which would have been so written off or retained for the depreciation of that asset over that period, if that profit had not been made, is treated as a realised profit made over that period.
