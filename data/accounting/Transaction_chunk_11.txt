the appropriate SUBMISSION_RESPONSE message. This message may include a GovTalkMessage Body payload returned from the back-end system. This payload is opaque to the Transaction Engine and will be associated with an appropriate XML namespace. The document contained within the Body element must therefore include a single root XML node which wraps the returned data. The client may request the response document more than once by issuing additional SUBMISSION_POLL messages before finally deleting the response with a DELETE_REQUEST message. This would be necessary, for example, if the client encountered a transmission error during the previous SUBMISSION_POLL and received an HTTP error.
