Via a consistent drumbeat of messaging to keep up a continued focus on scepticism and challenge It is crucial to ensure that messaging about scepticism and challenge is sustained even in the midst of workload pressures and hybrid working, and that auditors, especially those at junior levels, have the requisite understanding of scepticism and challenge and the guidance to exercise them, for example through real-life case studies. Working relationships and establishing psychological safety Summary For most auditors in the sample, there was significant overlap in their views of ‘working relationships’ and ‘leadership and communications’, with the way colleagues communicate and interact seen as a key component of relationships. This means that there are some consistent themes between this and the previous chapter. Auditors were also, perhaps unsurprisingly, more likely to talk about psychological safety in terms of its constituent parts, for example in terms of feeling safe, trusted, and ‘backed’ by other team members and able to take risks and offer challenge to them and senior auditors, rather than the overarching term itself. Across firms and levels, there was a degree of inconsistency in how effectively auditors feel professional relationships are currently working. Many auditors felt there is an underlying openness to, and often encouragement of, internal challenge within both teams and firms, which translates into more effective external challenge of management at audited entities. Additionally, there were numerous reports of auditors at all levels feeling ‘backed’ and supported by their firms and teams, and therefore achieving psychological safety. However, there was also consensus that, in practice, internal and external challenge can be hindered by a lack of time, which negatively impacts on the way auditors are working together, and specifically reduces the emphasis on collaboration, rapport and coaching which encourages effective scepticism and challenge. Hybrid working was similarly believed
