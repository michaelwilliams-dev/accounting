sufficient quality, but other months are not, whether the data can be split and just the data of sufficient quality used to gain evidence over a proportion of a transactions or balances. The next section of this guidance lays out a general approach to addressing outliers generated when using ADA to test a single population and includes a revenue focused example. General Approach to addressing outliers Almost all tools begin with the auditor developing an expectation for the population based on their understanding of the entity and its environment and ensuring that the selected tool is appropriate for the analysis being performed. The initial application of the tool may produce a result which matches expectations, with a number of exceptions for the auditor to investigate. Alternatively, it may generate a result which does not match expectations, with a far greater number of outliers than expected. Where the result does not meet the auditorâ€™s expectation, auditors should examine the result to determine if this is as a result of the population expectation being inappropriately set, perhaps due to the auditor not understanding the entity and its environment fully. Where this is the case, parameters may be re-calibrated, and the tool re-applied to the population. Please see guidance below on making this assessment. Once the auditor is satisfied that the tool is being deployed with the appropriately designed expectation parameters, the auditor begins substantive testing on any exceptions generated. For the remaining population, auditors will generally leverage testing undertaken elsewhere in the audit file in order to gain comfort over the non-exception population, as described below. Where the auditor has not obtained assurance over the non- exception population through testing elsewhere on the audit file, auditors should design procedures to collect sufficient appropriate audit evidence as required by the ISAs (UK).
