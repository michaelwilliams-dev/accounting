An entity shall determine the stand-alone selling price at contract inception of the distinct good or service underlying each performance obligation in the contract and allocate the transaction price in proportion to those stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling price is the price at which an entity would sell a good or service promised in a contract separately to a customer. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the observable price of a good or service when the entity sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, an entity shall estimate it. When estimating a stand-alone selling price, an entity shall take into account all information that is reasonably available to the entity, including market conditions, entity-specific factors and information about the customer or class of customer. An entity shall apply estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances. Suitable estimation methods include, but are not limited to, the following: adjusted market assessment approach – an entity could evaluate the market in which it sells goods or services and estimate the price that a customer in that market would be willing to pay for those goods or services. That approach might also include referring to prices from the entity’s competitors for similar goods or services and adjusting those prices as necessary to reflect the entity’s costs and margins. expected cost plus a margin approach – an entity could forecast its expected costs of transferring the good or service promised to a customer and then add an appropriate margin for that good or service. residual approach – only if the stand-alone selling price of a good or service is highly variable or uncertain, then an entity may estimate the stand-alone selling price by reference to the total
