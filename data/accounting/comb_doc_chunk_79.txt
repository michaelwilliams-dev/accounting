interest-free loan may be made between an entity and its director(s). The accounting for the measurement difference arising on the initial recognition of the loan will depend on whether the loan was made in the director’s capacity as a shareholder or for another reason. For example, in a situation where a director is the majority shareholder it generally can be presumed that the loan was made in the director’s capacity as a shareholder. This presumption can be rebutted, if, for example, loans between the entity and other third parties without an ownership interest in the entity (eg employees) are made on the same or similar terms. If a fixed term interest-free loan is made between the entity and a director in his/her capacity as a shareholder the accounting for the loan is similar to the accounting for a fixed term interest-free loan between a parent and its subsidiary shown in Example 2 above. As noted in Example 2, a fixed term interest-free loan consists, in substance, of two components. In the case of a fixed term loan between an entity and a director who is also a shareholder, the first component represents a loan at a market rate of interest and the second component is a capital contribution or distribution between the director and the entity. The numerical examples below demonstrate the accounting.10 A director provides a fixed term interest-free loan of CU1,000 to an entity owned by the director. The loan is considered to be provided by the director in his/her capacity as a shareholder. The present value of the loan using a market rate of interest of a similar loan is CU900. The difference of CU100 represents an additional investment by the owner which is recorded by the entity as a capital contribution. The entity would record the
