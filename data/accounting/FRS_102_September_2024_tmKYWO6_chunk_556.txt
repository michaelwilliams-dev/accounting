small companies regime is set out in company law. Section 1A applies to companies eligible for the small companies regime, LLPs eligible for the small LLPs regime and any other entity that would have met the criteria for the small companies regime had they been companies.

Respondents queried whether the same approach could be taken for larger entities applying FRS 102. The approach for larger entities was not changed because this would increase the length of FRS 102 and make it potentially less user- friendly, especially as a significant number of larger entities applying FRS 102 are not companies and the additional disclosure requirements would not be applicable to them. This approach was reconsidered as part of the Triennial Review 2017. No further changes were made (see paragraphs A.51 and A.52).
