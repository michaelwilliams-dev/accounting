discussions with audit committee chairs that audit planning had been completed just at the start of the fieldwork which led to a rushed process. Audit teams must allow the proper time for all the aspects of planning to ensure that there is a strong foundation for the rest of the audit process. It is encouraging that many firms are considering this through their Audit Quality Indicators (AQIs). Execution The execution of an audit plan is, of necessity, individually tailored to the facts and circumstances of the audit. There are a range of standards that need to be followed for every audit, or when particular approaches or tests are undertaken. Execution The fieldwork must comprise execution of the agreed audit plan following the ISAs (UK) and the FRC Ethical Standard, making use of the firmâ€™s audit methodology, tools and other resources needed by the audit team. Good audits will demonstrate how the audit team have applied high-quality judgement to assess the evidence they have obtained. Such evidence should be both corroborative and contradictory. A robustly executed audit will utilise an appropriate variety of audit tools to provide an effective audit approach.

Such occurrences may increase detection risk and should be avoided unless the actual approach used is at least as effective as the planned approach. Where there is a genuine need to vary the planned audit approach, the team must record the reason and have the change approved by the audit partner.
