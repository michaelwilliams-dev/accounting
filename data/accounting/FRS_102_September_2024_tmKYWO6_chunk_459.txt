Individual and separate financial statements When an entity prepares individual or separate financial statements, paragraphs 9.26, 14.4 and 15.9 require the entity to account for its investments in subsidiaries, associates, and jointly controlled entities either at cost less impairment or at fair value. If a first-time adopter measures such an investment at cost, it shall measure that investment at one of the following amounts in its individual or separate opening statement of financial position, as appropriate, prepared in accordance with this FRS: cost determined in accordance with Section 9 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, Section 14 Investments in Associates or Section 15 Investments in Joint Ventures at the date of transition; or deemed cost, which shall be the carrying amount at the date of transition as determined under the entity’s previous financial reporting framework. Compound financial instruments Paragraph 22.13 requires an entity to split a compound financial instrument into its liability and equity components at the date of issue. A first-time adopter need not separate those two components if the liability component is not outstanding at the date of transition to this FRS.

Assets in the development or production phases at the amount determined for the cost centre under the entity’s previous financial reporting framework. The entity shall allocate this amount to the cost centre’s underlying assets pro rata using reserve volumes
