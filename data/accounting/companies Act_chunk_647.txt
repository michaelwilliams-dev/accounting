receipt of notice of such an intended resolution the company must immediately send a copy of it to the auditor proposed to be removed. The auditor proposed to be removed may make with respect to the intended resolution representations in writing to the company (not exceeding a reasonable length) and request their notification to members of the company. The company must (unless the representations are received by it too late for it to do so)— in any notice of the resolution given to members of the company, state the fact of the representations having been made, and send a copy of the representations to every member of the company to whom notice of the meeting is or has been sent. If a copy of any such representations is not sent out as required because received too late or because of the company's default, the auditor may (without prejudice to his right to be heard orally) require that the representations be read out at the meeting. Copies of the representations need not be sent out and the representations need not be read at the meeting if, on the application either of the company or of any other person claiming to be aggrieved, the court is satisfied that the auditor is using the provisions of this section to secure needless publicity for defamatory matter. The court may order the company's costs (in Scotland, expenses) on the application to be paid in whole or in part by the auditor, notwithstanding that he is not a party to the application.
