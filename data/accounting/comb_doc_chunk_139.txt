no significant changes to the recognition of revenue. Basic Principles Scope and recognition FRS 5 – Application Note G|FRS 102| Applies to any activity giving rise to revenue. Provides that a seller recognises revenue when it obtains the right to consideration in exchange for its performance. (FRS 5 paragraph G4) Provides areas of specific guidance for a number of specified types of transactions (FRS 5 paragraph G1).|Provides recognition criteria for: the sale of goods; rendering of services; construction contracts in which the entity is the contractor; and interest, royalties and dividends. (FRS 102 paragraph 23.1).| There appears to be no difference in the basic scope and recognition principles.

(FRS 5 paragraph G7)|Requires revenue to be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.

(FRS 5 paragraph G8)|Requires that where payment is deferred under a financing transaction, the fair value of the consideration is measured as the present value of all future receipts determined using an imputed rate of interest. This imputed rate of interest is either the prevailing rate for a similar instrument of an issuer with a similar credit rating
