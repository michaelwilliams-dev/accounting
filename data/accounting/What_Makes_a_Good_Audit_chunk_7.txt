also crucial. Planning for more complex areas of the audit may involve relevant specialists, key audit partners and others appropriate to the situation being considered. The best interactions with specialists involve a clear two- way understanding of the relevant risks, the extent and timing of their involvement (if any) and the expectations from both sides. A team’s knowledge and understanding of a business and the environment it operates in must be tailored to the sector and the specific company. This knowledge needs to be distilled down to the relevant elements of the business model, the expected relationships and what the audit risks actually are. This can be challenging and the auditors must be mindful that a complex business model can result in an overly fragmented audit that is not focused on the right audit risks. Ultimately, a business prices its outputs based on its expected deployment of its people, processes and consumption of raw materials. It then has an expected working capital cycle derived from its key terms of trade. Understanding these core relationships is key to an effective audit. Of equal importance is knowledge about the size and disposition of the populations (transactions and balances) to be tested and the level of judgement needed, and specialist knowledge required, if a sampling approach is being used. This critical understanding will direct the audit approach in terms of sampling approach, testing strategy and whether it is necessary to involve relevant experts, including, for example, examination of the entity’s IT systems. Where such experts are used, the audit must be executed to ensure that sufficient time is given to the expert to complete their work and for the audit team to take account of their findings, including an understanding of the work of the expert and the impact of the findings on
