A2.13 An entity’s budget may include certain costs expected to be incurred irregularly during the financial year, such as charitable contributions and employee training costs. Those costs generally are discretionary even though they are planned and tend to recur from year to year. Recognising an obligation at the end of an interim financial reporting period for such costs that have not yet been incurred generally is not consistent with the definition of a liability. Measuring interim income tax expense A2.14 Interim period income tax expense is accrued using the tax rate that would be applicable to expected total annual earnings; that is, the estimated average annual effective income tax rate applied to the pre-tax income of the interim period. A2.15 This is consistent with the basic concept set out in paragraph 28 of FRS 104 that the same accounting recognition and measurement principles shall be applied in an interim financial report as are applied in annual financial statements. Income taxes are assessed on an annual basis. Interim period income tax expense is calculated by applying to an interim period’s pre-tax income the tax rate that would be applicable to expected total annual earnings; that is, the estimated average annual effective income tax rate. That estimated average annual rate would reflect a blend of the progressive tax rate structure expected to be applicable to the full year’s earnings including enacted or substantively enacted changes in the income tax rates scheduled to take effect later in the financial year. The estimated average annual income tax rate would be re-estimated on a year-to-date basis, consistent with paragraph 28 of FRS 104. Paragraph 16A of FRS 104 requires disclosure of a significant change in estimate.
