role would be to see that the work is carried out in accordance with the principal’s contract with the subcontractor and may include making payments to the subcontractor. Where the contract between the principal and the managing agent includes the maintenance of the property and the agent enters into a contract on their own behalf, even though this is done under the terms of the service contract between the agent and the principal, the agent will be acting as a contractor within the scheme. Payments made under a contract between the managing agent and the subcontractor may also fall within the scheme where it’s a mixed contract, for example, where it includes elements of security, cleaning, minor repairs and maintenance. Scheme representatives A contractor that is a company within a group may be authorised to appoint another of the companies within the same group to undertake its obligations under the scheme. For example, a group of several companies required to operate the scheme could choose a single company within the group to operate CIS on their behalf. The scheme representative must continue to make returns and payments to us under the name of the company or companies for which it’s acting. Each company that has chosen to have its scheme obligations handled by another company within its group will always remain liable for any obligations it has under the scheme even though it has chosen another company to operate the scheme on its behalf. Unoﬃcial forms No substitute forms may be used. If a form has been lost or mislaid, ask us for another. However, contractors will need to create their own statements of deduction for those subcontractors from whom deductions have been made.
