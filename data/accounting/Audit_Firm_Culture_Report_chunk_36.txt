demoralising factor likely to negatively impact their likelihood to exhibit scepticism and challenge. In particular, some junior auditors pointed to teams where there were disparities in the tasks allocated and how ‘hands-on’ senior auditors were with team members. A small number of auditors described feeling partners and directors can have ‘favourites’ and that their time is sometimes disproportionately spent, with some junior colleagues receiving more time, attention and feedback than others, and therefore inequality in the strength of junior auditors’ working relationships with senior staff. This was supported by some partner interviews where junior colleagues were described as being comparatively ‘weaker’ or ‘stronger’, with corresponding levels of trust in their abilities. "[Scepticism and challenge] is based on the attitude of senior members of the team" (Associate / Senior associate) Embedding new ways of working is limiting informal contact felt to be important to building and improving working relationships Ineffective embedding of hybrid working since Covid-19 was seen to have exacerbated some of these barriers to effective working relationships, while also creating new challenges. At some firms, there was felt to be little interaction between senior auditors (particularly partners, who have limited time, and responsibilities outside of specific audits), more senior managers, and junior auditors, and a sense that this is made worse when remote working has not been embedded effectively (e.g. partners and directors are not always making the required effort to reach out to junior auditors). However, audit managers themselves also reported fewer opportunities to interact with senior auditors, which in turn impacted on their relationships with them. In addition, there is consensus that scepticism and challenge are best taught via observation, for example by sitting in meetings, and that more could be done to translate this over to the context of hybrid working with the increased number of
