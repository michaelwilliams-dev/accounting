adjusted for a change in accounting estimate. Paragraph 16A(d) requires that the nature and amount of any significant changes in estimates are disclosed. [Deleted] Revenues received seasonally, cyclically, or occasionally Revenues that are received seasonally, cyclically, or occasionally within a financial year shall not be anticipated or deferred as of an interim date if anticipation or deferral would not be appropriate at the end of the entity’s financial year. Examples include dividend revenue, royalties, and government grants. Additionally, some entities consistently earn more revenues in certain interim periods of a financial year than in other interim periods, for example, seasonal revenues of retailers. Such revenues are recognised when they occur. Costs incurred unevenly during the financial year Costs that are incurred unevenly during an entity’s financial year shall be anticipated or deferred for interim reporting purposes if, and only if, it is also appropriate to anticipate or defer that type of cost at the end of the financial year. See paragraphs A2.3 to A2.38 of Appendix II to this FRS for illustrative examples of applying the requirements set out in paragraphs 28 to 39. Use of estimates The measurement procedures to be followed in an interim financial report shall be designed to ensure that the resulting information is reliable and that all material financial information that is relevant to an understanding of the financial position or performance of the entity is appropriately disclosed. While measurements in both annual and interim financial reports are often based on reasonable estimates, the preparation of interim financial reports generally will require a greater use of estimation methods than annual financial reports. See paragraphs A2.39 to A2.47 of Appendix II to this FRS for illustrative examples of the use of estimates in interim periods.
