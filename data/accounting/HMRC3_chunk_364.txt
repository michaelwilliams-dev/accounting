For small companies there�s also sub-classification called a micro-entity, which applies to very small companies. To determine whether your company is a micro-entity, small or medium-sized, there are thresholds for: turnover balance sheet total (meaning the total of the fixed and current assets) the average number of employees Any companies that do not meet the criteria for micro-entities, small or medium are large companies. Large companies must prepare and submit full accounts. Micro-entities can prepare and file a balance sheet with less information than for a small, medium or large company. Additionally, a micro-entity can benefit from the exemptions available to small companies such as: exemption from audit the requirement to file a directors� report or profit and loss account at Companies House Micro-entities still need to send accounts to their members and file accounts at Companies House.
