for the development of Codes, Standards and Guidance (2014) and, in particular, the extent to which the anticipated benefits from any changes to current practices would outweigh the costs incurred by the entities involved, were considered. It was concluded that this matter does not merit a change in accounting standards, and therefore no changes were made to FRS 102 (or FRS 105) in this regard. Triennial Review 2017 When FRS 102 was issued in March 2013, the FRC indicated that it would be reviewed every three years. This triennial review process was an opportunity to review the implementation of FRS 102 and whether it had achieved its aims, as well as to make improvements. The Triennial Review 2017 involved considering a wide range of potential sources of improvements and clarifications including: feedback from stakeholders on areas where FRS 102 can be improved; areas identified by the FRC for review; the IASBâ€™s 2015 Amendments to the IFRS for SMEs; and changes in IFRS Accounting Standards. Amongst other sources, the FRC received and considered feedback from stakeholders through a request for information, a consultation document on the approach to changes in IFRS Accounting Standards and exposure drafts setting out proposed amendments to FRS 102 (see Table 1 at the end of this Basis for Conclusions). FRS 102 is an IFRS-based solution that was developed from the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. Therefore amendments to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard remained a useful source for considering the development and maintenance of FRS 102. However, the scope of FRS 102 is wider than the scope of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard and the FRC takes into account the size and range of entities applying FRS 102 when considering potential amendments. This means changes in IFRS Accounting Standards were also relevant to FRS
