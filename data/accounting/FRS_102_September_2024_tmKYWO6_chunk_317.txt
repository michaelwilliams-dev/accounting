Example of the issuer’s accounting for convertible debt On 1 January 20X5 an entity issues 500 convertible bonds. The bonds are issued at par with a face value of CU100 per bond and are for a five-year term, with no transaction costs. The total proceeds from the issue are CU50,000. Interest is payable annually in arrears at an annual interest rate of 4%. Each bond is convertible, at the holder’s discretion, into 25 ordinary shares at any time up to maturity. At the time the bonds are issued, the market interest rate for similar debt that does not have the conversion option is 6%. When the instrument is issued, the liability component must be valued first, and the difference between the total proceeds on issue (which is the fair value of the instrument in its entirety) and the fair value of the liability component is assigned to the equity component. The fair value of the liability component is calculated by determining its present value using the discount rate of 6%. The calculations and journal entries are illustrated below: |CU| Proceeds from the bond issue (A)|50,000| Present value of principal at the end of five years (see calculations below)|37,363| Present value of interest payable annually in arrears for five years|8,425| Present value of liability, which is the fair value of liability component (B)|45,788| Residual, which is the fair value of the equity component (A) – (B)|4,212| The issuer of the bonds makes the following journal entry at issue on 1 January 20X5: Dr Cash|CU50,000| Cr Financial Liability – Convertible bond|CU45,788| Cr Equity|CU4,212| The CU4,212 represents a discount on issue of the bonds, so the entry could also be shown ‘gross’: Dr Cash|CU50,000| Dr Financial Liability – Convertible bond discount|CU4,212| Cr Financial Liability – Convertible bond|CU50,000| Cr Equity|CU4,212| After issue, the issuer
