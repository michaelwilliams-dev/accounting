analyse populations, particularly when they are used on a population for the first time. Where parameters are inappropriately defined initially, potentially due to a lack of understanding about the population itself, or the entity and its environment more widely, a significant number of outliers may be generated. In many cases, this volume of outliers is a symptom of poorly defined parameters. In using ADA to understand and assess the population being analysed, parameters may require re-calibration after initial analysis to ensure the tool is appropriately identifying outliers that merit further investigation as exceptions. Thoughtful application of the terminology of the auditing standards, particularly the use of the term “exception”, is important here in designing audit procedures that are both effective and efficient. Throughout this guidance we have used the term “outliers” to describe results generated by an ADA that do not match the auditor’s initial expectation for the population, moving to describe them as “exceptions” only when the auditor has analysed the outliers and determined that they are truly exceptions and not generated as a result of inappropriate tool scoping, poorly defined initial parameters, or the use of poor quality data. This situation is analogous to the development of an expectation when conducting analytical procedures in line with ISA (UK) 520 Analytical Procedures. ISA (UK) 5204 requires that the auditor “develops an expectation of recorded amounts or ratios and evaluate whether the expectation is sufficiently precise to identify a misstatement”. It is often the case that the first expectation built is insufficiently precise, and that subsequent refinement is required as the auditor develops a stronger understanding, before the expectation is suitable for comparison to the actual and is used to generate audit evidence. 3 ISA(UK) 520 Analytical Procedures, Paragraph 3 (b) 4 ISA (UK) 520 Analytical Procedures, Paragraph 5(c) An
