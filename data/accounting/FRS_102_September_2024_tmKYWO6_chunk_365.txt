Until the liability is settled, the entity shall remeasure the fair value of the liability at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the period. A The fair value of the liability shall be measured by reference to the fair value of the cash-settled share-based payment transaction. For example, share appreciation rights are measured by reference to the fair value of the underlying equity instruments measured in accordance with paragraphs 26.10 and 26.11. B A cash-settled share-based payment transaction might be conditional upon satisfying specified vesting conditions related to service or performance. Vesting conditions and conditions that are not vesting conditions are accounted for as follows: Vesting conditions, other than market vesting conditions, shall not be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the cash-settled share-based payment as at the measurement date. Instead, such vesting conditions shall be taken into account in estimating the number of awards expected to vest. The entity shall revise that estimate, if necessary, if subsequent information indicates that the number of awards that are expected to vest differs from previous estimates. On the vesting date, the entity shall revise the estimate to equal the number of awards that ultimately vested. All market vesting conditions and conditions that are not vesting conditions shall be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the cash-settled share-based payment at each reporting date and at the date of settlement. C As a result of applying paragraphs 26.14 to 26.14B, the cumulative amount ultimately recognised for goods or services received as consideration for the cash-settled share-based payment is equal to the cash that is paid. Share-based payment transactions with cash alternatives Some share-based payment transactions give either the entity or the counterparty a
