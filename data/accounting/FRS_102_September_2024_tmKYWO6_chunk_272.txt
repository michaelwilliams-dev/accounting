near the same time with the same counterparty (or related parties of the counterparty), and account for the contracts as a single contract if one or more of the following criteria are met: the contracts are negotiated as a package with an overall commercial objective that cannot be understood without considering the contracts together; the amount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract; or the rights to use underlying assets conveyed in the contracts (or some rights to use underlying assets conveyed in each of the contracts) form a single lease component as described in paragraph 20.29. Identifying a lease At the inception date, an entity shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. A contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset when, throughout the period of use, the customer has both the right to direct the use of the identified asset, and the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from that use. If the customer has the right to control the use of the identified asset for only a portion of the term of the contract, the contract contains a lease for that portion of the term. An entity shall assess whether a contract contains a lease for each potential separate lease component, as described in paragraph 20.27. An entity shall reassess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease only if the terms and conditions of the contract are changed.
