resulting gain or loss on the net monetary position included in the interim periodâ€™s profit or loss. Entities do not annualise the recognition of the gain or loss. Nor do they use an estimated annual inflation rate in preparing an interim financial report in a hyperinflationary economy. Impairment of assets A2.37 Section 27 Impairment of Assets of FRS 102 requires that an impairment loss be recognised if the recoverable amount has declined below carrying amount. A2.38 FRS 104 requires that an entity shall apply the same impairment testing, recognition, and reversal criteria at an interim date as it would at the end of its financial year. That does not mean, however, that an entity must necessarily make a detailed impairment calculation at the end of each interim period. Rather, an entity will review for indications of significant impairment since the end of the most recent financial year to determine whether such a calculation is needed. Examples of the use of estimates The following examples illustrate the application of the principle in paragraph 41 of FRS 104. Inventories A2.39 Full stock-taking and valuation procedures may not be required for inventories at interim dates, although it may be done at financial year-end. It may be sufficient to make estimates at interim dates based on sales margins. Classifications of assets and liabilities A2.40 Entities may do a more thorough investigation for classifying assets as current or fixed assets and liabilities as due within one year or after more than one year (or an equivalent classification between current and non-current assets and liabilities) at annual reporting dates than at interim dates. Provisions A2.41 Determination of the appropriate amount of a provision (such as a provision for warranties, environmental costs, and site restoration costs) may be complex and often costly and time-consuming. Entities sometimes engage
