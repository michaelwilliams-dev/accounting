product being produced simultaneously. This is the case, for example, when joint products are produced or when there is a main product and a by-product. When the costs of raw materials or conversion of each product are not separately identifiable, an entity shall allocate them between the products on a rational and consistent basis. The allocation may be based, for example, on the relative sales value of each product either at the stage in the production process when the products become separately identifiable, or at the completion of production. Most by-products, by their nature, are immaterial. When this is the case, the entity shall measure them at selling price less costs to complete and sell and deduct this amount from the cost of the main product. As a result, the carrying amount of the main product is not materially different from its cost. Other costs included in inventories An entity shall include other costs in the cost of inventories only to the extent that they are incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. [Deleted] Costs excluded from inventories Examples of costs excluded from the cost of inventories and recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred are: abnormal amounts of wasted materials, labour or other production costs; storage costs, unless those costs are necessary during the production process before a further production stage; administrative overheads that do not contribute to bringing inventories to their present location and condition; and selling costs. Cost of inventories of a service provider To the extent that service providers have inventories, they measure them at the costs of their production. These costs consist primarily of the labour and other costs of personnel directly engaged in providing the service, including supervisory personnel, and attributable overheads.
