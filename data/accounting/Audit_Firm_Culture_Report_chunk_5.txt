desired behaviours. Creating the right environment is crucial for establishing effective relationships and psychological safety across all levels, but this can be restricted when cultural hierarchies do not allow manager and junior level auditors to raise challenge upwards. This can be caused by a number of factors, such as; a lack of transparency around the rationale behind decisions and anineffective feedback processes that does not give audit managers and junior auditors room to grow. Alignment of reward and recognition with, as well as measure to define, desired auditor behaviour: There are felt to be inconsistencies in the extent to which the behaviours are explicitly linked to remuneration, reward, progression and feedback. This is particularly true for audit managers and junior auditors, who feel there is a lack of clarity on how quality is linked to positive reward at their level. How external influences and other stakeholders impact desired auditor behaviours Looking outside audit firms, at external influences, our research has identified that: The relationship between the audit firm and the audited entity plays a crucial role in allowing, or preventing, scepticism and challenge. This is felt to work best as an enabler for the desired auditor behaviours when upfront planning sessions that establish ways of working include expectation management, specifically around the application of scepticism and challenge being a central part of the firmâ€™s independent role. This should also include senior auditor involvement to show that any challenge is backed by the firm. Audit Committees can help or hinder scepticism and challenge. Audit Committees are felt to be most effective when they have an up-to-date understanding of the role of audit, and of the audit firm itself, including the requirement to exercise scepticism and challenge as an independent entity in order to achieve a high-quality audit.
