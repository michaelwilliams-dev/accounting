For all entities with long-term insurance business, the best basis for measuring policyholders’ options and guarantees is one that includes their time value2. Any deterministic approach to valuation of a policy with a guarantee or optionality feature will generally fail to deal appropriately with the time value of the option. Therefore stochastic modelling techniques to evaluate the range of potential outcomes should be used unless a market value for the option is available. The regulatory framework includes a requirement to value options and guarantees on this basis. For the liabilities of businesses not falling within the scope of paragraph 3.1(b) of FRS 103, entities are encouraged, but not required, to adopt these valuation techniques. Where options are not valued on this basis, additional disclosures are required; these are set out in paragraph IG3.14(c). IG1.13 In determining the value of guarantees and options under the regulatory framework, the entity will take into account under each scenario in the market-consistent stochastic modelling management actions it anticipates would be taken in response to variations in market variables (such as changing the balance of the investment portfolio between debt instruments and equity, varying the amount charged to policyholders, or varying its bonus policy) that will affect the amount payable under the guarantee or option. Such actions must be realistically capable of being implemented within the timescale assumed in the scenario analysis, and be consistent with the entity’s published principles and practices of financial managements (PPFM). 2 The value of an option or guarantee comprises two elements; the intrinsic value and the time value. The intrinsic value is the amount that would be payable if the option or guarantee were exercised immediately – that is, the amount it is currently ‛in the moneyʼ, or nil if it is ‛out of the moneyʼ. The time value
