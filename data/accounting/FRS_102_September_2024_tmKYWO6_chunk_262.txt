those depreciable assets at the acquisition date, ie their cost to the acquirer. [Moved to paragraph 19.10A] [Moved to paragraph 19.15D and amended] If the initial accounting for a business combination (the allocation of the cost of a business combination to the assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed) is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the acquirer shall recognise in its financial statements provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Within 12 months after the acquisition date, the acquirer shall retrospectively adjust the provisional amounts recognised as assets and liabilities at the acquisition date (ie account for them as if they were made at the acquisition date) to reflect new information obtained about any relevant facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Any adjustments made will have an impact upon the goodwill (or negative goodwill) recognised. Beyond 12 months after the acquisition date, adjustments to reflect new information obtained about any relevant facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date shall be made prospectively (and therefore will not have an impact upon the goodwill (or negative goodwill) recognised), except that adjustments to the initial accounting for a business combination shall be recognised to correct a material error in accordance with Section 10 Accounting Policies, Estimates and Errors. Leases in which the acquiree is the lessee A The acquirer shall recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases identified in accordance with Section 20 Leases in which the acquiree is the lessee. The acquirer is not required to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for: leases for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the acquisition date; or leases for which the underlying asset is of low value (as described in Section 20).
