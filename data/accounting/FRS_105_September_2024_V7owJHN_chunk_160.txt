which a micro-entity has to measure at cost and depreciated cost respectively. Further simplifications over and above the legal requirements The micro-entities regime is intended to be deregulatory and therefore some of the accounting requirements applicable under FRS 102 were simplified for inclusion in FRS 105. Simplifications were made if: the benefits of applying the accounting treatment in FRS 102 do not outweigh the burden for micro-entities and an alternative, more straightforward, treatment could be identified; the lack of detail in the formats of the financial statements and/or supporting disclosures would limit the understanding of the financial information presented; and/or transactions occur infrequently amongst micro-entities. It was noted that permitting accounting policy options in FRS 105 would add complexity for preparers of a micro-entity’s financial statements and could cause confusion to users due to the lack of detail in the formats of the financial statements and supporting disclosures to explain the policy choice taken. As a result, FRS 105 does not contain accounting policy options, except on first-time adoption of FRS 105, and in all cases, FRS 105 mandates the most straightforward and easy to apply option. First-time adopters of FRS 105 are allowed to choose whether to apply the requirements of FRS 105 fully retrospectively or whether to apply one or more of the transitional exemptions. Although this introduced a degree of complexity for preparers and users, transitional exemptions are important for a smooth transition and not allowing a choice disadvantages micro-entities unnecessarily over entities that adopt FRS 102. The key areas where simplifications were made as follows: Prohibition of accounting for deferred taxation on the basis that this is a complex area of accounting and the lack of disclosure in a micro-entity’s financial statements would make it impossible to distinguish between current and deferred tax.
