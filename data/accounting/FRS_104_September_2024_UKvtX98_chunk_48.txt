and Ireland accounting standards. In 2012, during the development of FRS 102, the FRC consulted on the introduction of interim financial reporting requirements into that FRS. It proposed that entities applying FRS 102 and preparing interim financial reports should apply IAS 34. Some respondents highlighted a potential issue with the scope in that it might have extended the requirement to prepare interim reports beyond those set by the relevant regulators. Consequently, rather than requiring application of IAS 34 by those entities preparing interim reports, the ASB Statement Half-yearly Financial Reports was reviewed with a view to replacing it with a new standard. In November 2014, draft FRS 104 was proposed. It was based on IAS 34, with certain adaptations to tailor the reporting requirements to entities that prepare their annual financial statements in accordance with FRS 102. FRS 104 was developed primarily for entities preparing their annual financial statements in accordance with FRS 102. However, a small number of entities may prepare their annual financial statements in accordance with FRS 101. These entities may be required to produce half-yearly financial reports in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTRs) because, although being a member of a larger group, they have issued their own listed debt securities. As only a small minority of entities that apply FRS 101 will also produce interim financial reports, it was concluded that it was not an effective solution to develop a separate set of interim reporting requirements solely for entities that apply FRS 101. Instead, as set out in FRS 104, these entities should apply the requirements applicable to entities that use FRS 102, except that any reference to a specific requirement in FRS 102 is read as a reference to the equivalent requirement in adopted IFRS, as amended by paragraph AG1 of FRS
