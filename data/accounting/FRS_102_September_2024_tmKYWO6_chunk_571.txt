This approach provides a proportionate solution to usersâ€™ information needs by ensuring that all entities with supplier finance arrangements will provide disclosure, whether on a group basis or for the individual company.

True and fair view B1A.2 The financial statements of a small company must give a true and fair view of the financial performance and financial position of the entity; this has been emphasised in Section 1A. The directors of a small company will need to consider whether additional disclosures are necessary to give a true and fair view and, if so, provide those additional disclosures. B1A.3 To help small entities applying Section 1A, generally the disclosures required by law are included and cross-referenced to the same or similar disclosures elsewhere in FRS 102. For UK small entities this is set out in Appendix C Disclosure requirements for small entities in the UK to Section 1A; for Irish small entities this is set out in Appendix D Disclosure requirements for small entities in the Republic of Ireland to Section 1A, which was added in December 2017 following the implementation of the EU Accounting Directive in Ireland in June 2017. The drafting of these disclosures is as close as possible to the relevant company law requirements, with a note of the source of the legal requirement, and an indication of which paragraphs of FRS 102 address similar requirements. B1A.3A Section 1A was developed to reflect company law requirements as well as an additional requirement of the EU Accounting Directive, which precludes Member States from imposing specific disclosure requirements on small entities besides the limited disclosures set out
