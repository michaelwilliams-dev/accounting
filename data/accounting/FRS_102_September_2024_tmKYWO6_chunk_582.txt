As a result, these requirements of FRS 102 are based on IFRS 3 (issued 2004).

Control in PBE sectors B9.13 The issues of control and the indicators of control that may be specific to the PBE sectors were considered. The indicators of control set out in Section 9 focus on benefits, and in the PBE sectors, benefit can be in the form of indirect benefit through a PBE’s beneficiaries or benefit which furthers a PBE’s activities. It was concluded that FRS 102 can
