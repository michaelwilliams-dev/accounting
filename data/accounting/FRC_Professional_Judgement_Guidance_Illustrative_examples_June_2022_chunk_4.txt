debt should be supported by further clarifying information The engagement partner knows that IFRS is a fair presentation framework, and that it requires that the financial statements must fairly present the financial position and performance of the entity. IFRS defines the objective of the financial statements as being to provide information about the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions. Her concern, then, is that the capital management disclosure referencing net debt obscures useful information, or is actively misleading, regarding the level of net debt that the company carried for most of the year. If it does so, it is arguably not fairly presented and thus not in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards. This would be a misstatement, which could be material if it could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements. The engagement partner understands that any assessment of whether the disclosure might be misleading requires consideration of the perspectives of the intended users; in order to determine whether they might be misled, she must develop an understanding of how they might take in and use the information. The engagement partner knows from experience that many investors and potential investors look at net debt levels and the capital structure of companies when making investment decisions, but does not have extensive experience with listed companies in this specific industry, so undertakes to research the matter further. The engagement partner enquires with F plcâ€™s management about their reasoning in presenting the information in the way that they did, and whether they considered adding further disclosures to clarify that the year end position was unusual and transient.
