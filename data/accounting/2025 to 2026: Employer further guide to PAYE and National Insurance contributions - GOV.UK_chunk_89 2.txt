YouÕll be liable for the payment of National Insurance contributions (both employee and employer) in respect of that person. YouÕll have to register with HMRC as an employer if you have not done so already. 4.6 Employees coming to or leaving the UK Ñ treatment for PAY E purposes 4.6.1 Liability to pay National Insurance contributions
