IASBâ€™s Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7) was identified as a suitable basis for the development of similar amendments to FRS 102. In deciding to base the amendments to FRS 102 on similar amendments to IFRS 9 the FRC made a number of changes including simplifications and changes to reflect existing differences between IFRS 9 and FRS 102. The amendments were supported by respondents. B11.73 As a result of these amendments, entities will apply specific hedge accounting requirements assuming that the interest rate benchmark relevant to the hedge accounting is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform. B11.74 The temporary amendments to specific hedge accounting requirements are not intended to change the requirement that entities measure and recognise hedge ineffectiveness, which should continue to be measured and recognised in accordance with FRS 102 (or IFRS 9 or IAS 39 depending on the accounting policy choice made by the entity). Entities should continue to apply assumptions that are consistent with those applied to the hedged risk of the hedged item. For example, if an entity designated interest rate benchmark-based cash flows as the hedged item in a cash flow hedge, the entity would not assume, for the purposes of measuring hedge ineffectiveness, that the expected replacement of the interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate will result in zero cash flows after the replacement. Interest rate benchmark reform (Phase 2) B11.75 The effective date is accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020, with early application permitted. B11.76 In December 2020 additional amendments were made to address the accounting implications associated with the replacement of interest rate benchmarks, referred to as Phase 2 of the interest rate benchmark reform related amendments.
