However, respondents in favour of the cost model would expect the cost model to mean that both biological assets and agricultural produce would be measured at cost. B34A.4 Agricultural produce should be capable of measurement at fair value without undue cost or effort, and should provide more relevant information to users. However, respondents argued that agricultural businesses often manage their business on the basis of cost information and agricultural produce should be permitted to be measured at cost.
