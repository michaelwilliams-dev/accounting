using separate weighted average estimated effective tax rates for each of the income tax years applied to the portion of pre-tax income earned in each of those income tax years. A2.20 To illustrate, an entityâ€™s financial reporting year ends on 30 June and it reports quarterly. Its taxable year ends on 31 December. For the financial year that begins 1 July, Year 1 and ends 30 June, Year 2, the entity earns CU10,000 pre-tax each quarter. The estimated average annual income tax rate is 30% in Year 1 and 40% in Year 2. |Quarter ending 30 Sep Year 1|Quarter ending 31 Dec Year 1|Quarter ending 31 Mar Year 2|Quarter ending 30 Jun Year 2|Year ending 30 Jun Year 2| Tax expense|CU3,000|CU3,000|CU4,000|CU4,000|CU14,000| Tax credits A2.21 Some tax jurisdictions give taxpayers credits against the tax payable based on amounts of capital expenditures, exports, research and development expenditures, or other bases. Anticipated tax benefits of this type for the full year are generally reflected in computing the estimated annual effective income tax rate, because those credits are granted and calculated on an annual basis under most tax laws and regulations. On the other hand, tax benefits that relate to a one-off event are recognised in computing income tax expense in that interim period, in the same way that special tax rates applicable to particular categories of income are not blended into a single effective annual tax rate.
