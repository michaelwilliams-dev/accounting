frequently when associates are seen to have only searched for corroborating and not contradictory evidence. Overall, this can weigh heavily on those at the manager level across firms without receiving recognition – financial or otherwise – for taking on extra work to rectify this. “The long hours we put in don’t get recognised.

Many associates felt that working hard is often the main determinant in measuring their performance, particularly during busy periods, with the reward for good work generally being allocated to more complex, time-consuming work, without any further recognition. For some this can lead to a negative spiral that they believe damages motivation and their ability to show curiosity, scepticism and challenge during audit engagements. Senior auditors in particular felt that this lack of correlation between progression and quality at the more junior levels presents a significant missed opportunity to drive home the importance of these behaviours. Furthermore, many associates themselves do not believe that they are always recognised when they do exhibit them. In particular, across all firms there was a belief that bonus schemes at this level are negligible and not linked to the ability to show scepticism and challenge. “Most juniors get naturally promoted with their pay connected to exams, so it doesn’t feel like it’s always clear to them what is
