In this case, on grant date the micro-entity shall recognise the services received in full, with a corresponding liability. If the cash-settled share-based payments do not vest until the counterparty completes a specified period of service, the micro-entity shall presume that the services to be rendered by the counterparty as consideration for those cash-settled share-based payments will be received in the future, during the vesting period.

When the micro-entity has a choice of settlement of the transaction in cash (or other assets) or by the transfer of equity instruments, the micro-entity shall account for the whole transaction as set out in paragraph 21.2 unless: the choice of settlement in equity instruments has no commercial substance (eg because the micro-entity is legally prohibited from issuing shares); or the micro-entity has a past practice or a stated policy of settling in cash, or generally settles in cash whenever the counterparty asks for cash settlement.
