must additionally comment on the reasonableness of management judgements embedded in these reports: and while a lower standard of accuracy is permitted of auditors here, a similar standard of scrutiny as applied to financial statements is expected of them. That, in a nutshell, is the purpose of audits. Next, let me address why the FRC is writing a report on auditor scepticism and challenge. Principally, this is because the general public feel that when managers cook the books (usually through unreasonable business judgements embedded in their accounting assumptions), auditors don’t do enough to stop them. They do not challenge the managers as forcibly as to forestall the chicanery. Particularly since the 2008 global financial crisis, there has been a widespread perception that the market economy works for insiders (managers and wealthy investors) more so than for average investors, and there is a perception that auditors have wantonly or unwittingly enabled this situation. So, what does success for a report such as the FRC’s ‘What Makes a Good Environment for Auditor Scepticism and Challenge’ look like? This is certainly not the first report on a culture of challenge in audit firms: indeed, there have been several in the last few years, particularly following on from the disaster that was Carillion. And this earlier tranche of audit-challenge reports appears to have been somewhat successful: The data from the focus groups conducted by BritainThinks suggest that employees of all ranks at audit firms are more aware of the need for a culture of challenge than a few years ago. But each of those reports has a certain natural shelf-life, and with a few years passed since the last tranche (they were, notably, pre-pandemic), it is time to reinvigorate the corporate- governance environment with another such report. That is what the FRC must seek
