relating to sales and general administrative personnel are not included but are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. The cost of inventories of a service provider does not include profit margins or non-attributable overheads that are often factored into prices charged by service providers. Cost of agricultural produce harvested from biological assets Section 34 requires that inventories comprising agricultural produce that an entity has harvested from its biological assets should be measured on initial recognition, at the point of harvest, at either their fair value less costs to sell or the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. This becomes the cost of the inventories at that date for application of this section. Techniques for measuring cost, such as standard costing, retail method and most recent purchase price An entity may use techniques such as the standard cost method, the retail method or most recent purchase price for measuring the cost of inventories if the result approximates cost. Standard costs take into account normal levels of materials and supplies, labour, efficiency and capacity utilisation. They are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, revised in the light of current conditions. The retail method measures cost by reducing the sales value of the inventory by the appropriate percentage gross margin. Cost formulas An entity shall measure the cost of inventories of items that are not ordinarily interchangeable and goods or services produced and segregated for specific projects by using specific identification of their individual costs. An entity shall measure the cost of inventories, other than those dealt with in paragraph 13.17, by using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or weighted average cost formula. An entity shall use the same cost formula for all inventories having a similar nature and use to the entity.
