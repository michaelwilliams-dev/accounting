non-audit services in 2021. This is a brief snapshot of some key indicators relating to market dynamics and competition, and more information on the audit market is available in our Key Facts and Trends in the Accountancy Profession publications (KFAT).

Audit Fees from Audited Entities were provided by audit firms in the AQR Inspection Scope Survey. However, these fees were not provided on a UK-firm-only basis, and therefore the AQR Inspection Scope Survey shows a higher total value of PIE audit fees than KFAT. Proportions may change slightly in future years when data allows a calculation to be done on a UK-firm-only basis. 2. ‘Other listed equity’ refers to companies with an equity listing on a regulated market that are not constituents of the FTSE 350. ‘Listed debt’ refers to companies with a debt listing on a regulated market.
