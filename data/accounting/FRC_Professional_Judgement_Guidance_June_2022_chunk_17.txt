The auditor may wish to actively consider the case for conclusions other than the one they have preliminarily reached, as a strategy for uncovering and mitigating biases.

In some specific situations (including when assessing estimates, going concern and the risk of misstatement due to fraud or error) this ‘stand back’ approach is a requirement of UK auditing standards.
