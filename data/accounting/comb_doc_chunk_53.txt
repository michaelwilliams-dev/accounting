joint ventures at fair value have been removed. Section 18 Intangible Assets New requirements intangible assets acquired in a business combination As noted on page 2, Section 18 has been amended to make the requirements in relation to intangible assets acquired in a business combination more straightforward. Entities are required to recognise separately from goodwill some, but not all intangible assets acquired in a business combination (ie if the intangible asset meets the recognition critieria, is separable and arises from contractual or other legal rights). There is an additional option for entities to separately recognise more intangible assets from goodwill although if this option is taken, it must be applied consistently to a class of intangible asset and to all business combinations.

Section 26 Share-based Payments Minor improvements only A number of minor improvements were made to Section 26 to align some of the definitions to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. It is not expected that any of these amendments will change the accounting treatment. Section 33 Related Party Disclosures New exemption introduced in relation to key management personnel compensation A new exemption has been introduced that allows companies (who are required by company law to disclose directors remuneration) not to disclose key management personnel compensation if there is no difference between key management personnel and directors.
