and decrease the assetâ€™s fair value less costs to sell. The carrying amount of the net assets of the micro-entity is more than the estimated fair value of the micro-entity as a whole (such an estimate may have been made, for example, in relation to the potential sale of part or all of the micro-entity). Internal sources of information Evidence is available of obsolescence or physical damage of an asset. Significant changes with an adverse effect on the micro-entity have taken place during the period, or are expected to take place in the near future, in the extent to which, or manner in which, an asset is used or is expected to be used. These changes include the asset becoming idle, plans to discontinue or restructure the operation to which an asset belongs, plans to dispose of an asset before the previously expected date, and reassessing the useful life of an asset as finite rather than indefinite. Evidence is available from internal reporting that indicates that the economic performance of an asset is, or will be, worse than expected. In this context economic performance includes operating results and cash flows. If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, this may indicate that the micro-entity should review the remaining useful life, the depreciation (amortisation) method or the residual value for the asset and adjust it in accordance with the section of this FRS applicable to the asset (eg Section 12 Property, Plant and Equipment and Investment Property and Section 13 Intangible Assets other than Goodwill), even if no impairment loss is recognised for the asset. Measuring recoverable amount The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. It is not always necessary to determine both
