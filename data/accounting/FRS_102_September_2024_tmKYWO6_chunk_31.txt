However, because those disclosures are usually considered relevant to giving a true and fair view, a small entity may need to provide any of those disclosures that are relevant to material transactions, other events or conditions of the small entity in order to meet the requirement set out in paragraphs 1A.5 and 1A.16. 1A.17A In accordance with paragraph 3.16B a small entity need not provide a specific disclosure (including those set out in paragraph 1A.16A and Appendix C or Appendix D to this section, as relevant) if the information resulting from that disclosure is not material, except when required by the Act regardless of materiality. 1A.18 [Moved to paragraph 1A.16A] 1A.19 [Moved to paragraph 1A.16B and
