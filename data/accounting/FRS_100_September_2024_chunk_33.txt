However, Part 4 of those regulations does require qualifying partnerships to comply with the requirement in Part 6 of the Companies Act 2014 to prepare financial statements that give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position as at the financial year end date and of the profit or loss for the financial year. This FRS applies to financial statements intended to give a true and fair view. Other A3.7 The following tables are intended as a reference guide to the corresponding or similar provisions in Irish law and do not purport to be complete. As such, it may be necessary to make reference to other Irish law as appropriate. It should be noted too that not all Irish legal provisions directly correspond to UK legal provisions and reference should be made to Irish law for an understanding of the relevant requirements. For example, references to ‘UK-adopted international accounting standards’ in UK company law correspond to provisions in Irish law that refer to EU-adopted IFRS. It should also be noted that various sections and paragraphs referenced may have been amended by legislation subsequent to the issuing of this FRS, and reference should be made to such amended text where applicable.
