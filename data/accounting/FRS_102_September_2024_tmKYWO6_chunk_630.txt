should also address situations where a multi-employer pension plan was in surplus, and had entered into an agreement to distribute that surplus to the participating employers. Although it was noted that this was addressed in IAS 19, it is expected that the situation would arise rarely in practice, and that entities would be able to determine the appropriate accounting using the principles set out in FRS 102. Therefore no amendment was made for this.

B28.8B Some multi-employer defined benefit plans had been carrying out exercises with a view to being able to provide sufficient information to participating employers in the future, which generated debate over the relevant requirements of FRS 102. There were differences of opinion over how the previous requirements of FRS 102 should be applied in this circumstance, with at least three alternative treatments being proposed. If this had led to differences in accounting practice by employers participating in the same multi-employer defined benefit plan it would have been unhelpful to users of financial statements.
