parts that are replaced is derecognised in accordance with paragraphs 17.27 to 17.30 regardless of whether the replaced parts had been depreciated separately. If it is impracticable for an entity to identify the carrying amount of the replaced part, it may be estimated using the current cost of the replacement part as a proxy for the original cost of the replaced part and adjusting it for depreciation and impairment. Paragraph 17.16 provides that if the major components of an item of property, plant and equipment have significantly different patterns of consumption of economic benefits, an entity shall allocate the initial cost of the asset to its major components and depreciate each such component separately over its useful life. A condition of continuing to operate an item of property, plant and equipment (eg a bus) may be performing regular major inspections for faults regardless of whether parts of the item are replaced. When each major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the item of property, plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the previous major inspection (as distinct from physical parts) is derecognised. This is done regardless of whether the cost of the previous major inspection was identified in the transaction in which the item was acquired or constructed. If necessary, the estimated cost of a future similar inspection may be used as an indication of what the cost of the existing inspection component was when the item was acquired or constructed. Land and buildings are separable assets, and an entity shall account for them separately, even when they are acquired together. Initial measurement An entity shall measure an item of property, plant and equipment at initial recognition at its cost. Elements
