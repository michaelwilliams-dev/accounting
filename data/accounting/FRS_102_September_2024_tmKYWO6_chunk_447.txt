that the legacy will be received and its value can be measured reliably. Whether receipt of a legacy is probable and whether its value can be measured reliably may be affected by events such as valuations and disputes. An entity shall apply Section 32 Events after the End of the Reporting Period to determine whether the receipt of evidence about a legacy after the reporting date is an adjusting event after the end of the reporting period. When a legacy meets the definition of a contingent asset, the entity shall not recognise it but shall provide the disclosures required by paragraph 21.16. Similarly, when a legacy meets the definition of an asset but the recognition criteria are not met, the entity is encouraged to consider disclosing information relevant to users’ understanding of the entity’s financial position. In determining the probability of receipt and reliability of measurement, and in measuring the expected inflow, an entity may apply estimates and assumptions to a portfolio of legacies if the entity reasonably expects that the result of doing so would not differ materially from the result of applying this paragraph to each individual legacy. PBE34.70B The recognition of receipts of resources from non-exchange transactions will result in the recognition of income and a corresponding asset or expense. There may be circumstances when resources are used in the production of an asset, for example erecting a building. In these cases, the associated resources would be recognised as a part of the cost of that asset. When a lease contains a non-exchange transaction (eg when the lease payments are significantly below market rents), the incoming resources shall be accounted for as a receipt of resources that form part of the cost of the right-of-use asset. PBE34.71 An entity shall recognise a liability for any resource that
