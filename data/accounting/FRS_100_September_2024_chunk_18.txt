Paragraph 9 states that reference should be made to this Application Guidance in deciding whether the consolidated financial statements of the group provide disclosures which are equivalent to the requirements of adopted IFRS. AG24 Similarly, paragraph 1.12 of FRS 102 provides certain exemptions for a qualifying entity from the disclosure requirements of FRS 102, provided that disclosures equivalent to those required by FRS 102 are included in the consolidated financial statements of the group in which the entity is consolidated. Paragraph 1.13 states that reference shall be made to this Application Guidance in deciding whether the consolidated financial statements of the group provide disclosures which are equivalent to the requirements of FRS 102. AG25 In deciding whether the consolidated financial statements of the parent provide disclosures which are equivalent to the requirements of adopted IFRS or FRS 102, from which relief is provided in paragraph 8 of FRS 101 and paragraph 1.12 of FRS 102 respectively, it is intended that preparers will apply similar considerations to those set out in paragraph AG6. That is, the concept of ‘equivalence’ referred to in those paragraphs of FRS 101 and FRS 102 is intended to be aligned to that in, for UK entities, section 401 of the Act and, for Irish entities, section 300 of the Companies Act 2014. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether the consolidated financial statements of the parent provide disclosures that meet the basic disclosure requirements of the relevant standard issued (or adopted) by the relevant standard setter, without requiring strict conformity with each and every disclosure. This assessment should be based on the particular facts, including the similarities to and differences from the requirements of the relevant standard from which relief is provided. AG26 Disclosure exemptions for subsidiaries are permitted when the relevant equivalent disclosures are made
