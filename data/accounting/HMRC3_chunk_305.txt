At that meeting, the members of the company can re-appoint the auditor, or appoint a di?erent auditor, to hold o?ce from the end of that meeting until the end of the next meeting at which the directors lay accounts. For private companies, the directors appoint the first auditor of the company. The members may then appoint or re-appoint an auditor each year at a meeting of the company�s members, or by written resolution, within 28 days of the directors sending the accounts to the members. If they do not do so for a particular year, the appointed auditor remains in o?ce until the members pass a resolution to reappoint him or to remove him as auditor (5% of members, or fewer if the articles say so, can force the consideration of a resolution to remove an auditor). This provision does not apply if the auditor�s most recent appointment was by the directors or the company�s articles require annual appointment. 15.2 What an auditor does The auditor conducts the audit in accordance with UK-adopted International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
