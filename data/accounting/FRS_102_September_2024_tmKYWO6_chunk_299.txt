of this FRS requires the cost to be recognised as part of the cost of an asset such as inventories or property, plant and equipment. The condition in paragraph 21.4(a) means that the entity has no realistic alternative to settling the obligation. This can happen when the entity has a legal obligation that can be enforced by law or when the entity has a constructive obligation because the past event (which may be an action of the entity) has created valid expectations in other parties that the entity will discharge the obligation. Obligations that will arise from the entityâ€™s future actions (ie the future conduct of its business) do not satisfy the condition in paragraph 21.4(a), no matter how likely they are to occur and even if they are contractual. To illustrate, because of commercial pressures or legal requirements, an entity may intend or need to carry out expenditure to operate in a particular way in the future (for example, by fitting smoke filters in a particular type of factory). Because the entity can avoid the future expenditure by its future actions, for example by changing its method of operation or selling the factory, it has no present obligation for that future expenditure and no provision is recognised. Initial measurement An entity shall measure a provision at the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the reporting date. The best estimate is the amount an entity would rationally pay to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period or to transfer it to a third party at that time. When the provision involves a large population of items, the estimate of the amount reflects the weighting of all possible outcomes by their associated probabilities. Where there is a continuous range of possible outcomes, and
