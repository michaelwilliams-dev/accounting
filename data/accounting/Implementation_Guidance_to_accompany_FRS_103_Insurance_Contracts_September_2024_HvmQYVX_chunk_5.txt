Where there is not a direct link between the value of the business and the amount of realistic liabilities, but the value is taken into account in determining those liabilities, it is appropriate to recognise the total value of the business. Although not separately identifiable, any excess value over that included in realistic liabilities will be taken to the FFA. 1 And Republic of Ireland with-profits funds.

IG1.6 The VIF recognised within assets as described in paragraph IG1.3 is determined as the discounted value of future profits expected to arise from the policies, taking into account liabilities relating to the policies measured on the statutory solvency basis.
