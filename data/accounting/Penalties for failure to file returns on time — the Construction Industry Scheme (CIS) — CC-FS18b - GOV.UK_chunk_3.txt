Where a CIS return only relates to subcontractors registered for gross payments, there’s no liability to make payments shown on the return. We therefore charge a penalty of £300 when the return is 6 months late. When the return is 12 months late we charge £300 or £1,500 or £3,000 depending on why your return was late. What happens if you have a reasonable excuse We will not charge you any penalties for filing a return late if you had a reasonable excuse for doing so — as long as you filed the return without any unreasonable delay after the excuse had ended.

It might be due to circumstances outside your control or a combination of events. Once the reasonable excuse has ended, you must put things right without any unnecessary delay. Whether you have a reasonable excuse depends upon the circumstances of the failure to meet the obligation and your particular situation and abilities. This may mean that what is a reasonable excuse for one person may not be a reasonable excuse for someone else. If you think you’ve a reasonable excuse please tell us.
