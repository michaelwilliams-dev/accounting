will not treat the subcontractor’s invoice as having been paid until payment is made to the card company, then that will be the point at which the payment should be included on the monthly return. Although there is no particular reason why cards cannot be used to make payments to subcontractors paid under deduction, doing so would lead to a number of problems.
