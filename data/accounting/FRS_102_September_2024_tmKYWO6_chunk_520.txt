measured at an amount that reflects the relief available. Realised profits A3.25 Paragraph 13(a) of Schedule 1 to the Regulations requires that only profits realised at the reporting date are included in profit or loss, a requirement modified from that in Article 31.1(c)(aa) of the Fourth Directive which refers to profits ‘made’ at the balance sheet date. A3.26 Paragraph 36 and paragraph 39 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations allow financial instruments, stocks, investment property, and living animals and plants to be held at fair value in Companies Act accounts. A3.27 Paragraph 40(2) of Schedule 1 to the Regulations then requires that movements in the value of financial instruments, investment properties and living animals and plants are recognised in the profit and loss account, notwithstanding the usual restrictions allowing only realised profits and losses to be included in the profit and loss account. Paragraph 40 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations thereby overrides the requirements of paragraph 13(a) of Schedule 1. A3.28 Entities measuring financial instruments, investment properties, and living animals and plants at fair value should note that they may transfer such amounts to a separate non-distributable reserve, instead of a transfer to retained earnings, but are not required to do so. Presenting fair value movements, that are not distributable profits, in the separate reserve may assist with the identification of profits available for that purpose. A3.29 The determination of profits available for distribution is a complex area where accounting and company law interface. In determining profits available for distribution an entity may refer to Technical Release 02/17BL Guidance on realised and distributable profits under the Companies Act 2006 issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, or any successor document, to determine profits available for distribution.
