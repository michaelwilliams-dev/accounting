removal of the policy options was potentially an over-simplification for the UK and Republic of Ireland. The IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard had been developed by the IASB for countries that had a less developed financial reporting framework than the UK and Republic of Ireland. Respondents considered that when options existed in previous accounting standards, the simplification had not been justified. The removal of the policy options would reduce comparability between entities that apply EU-adopted IFRS and those applying FRS 102 for entities operating in the same market. For example, entities applying FRS 102 would not be permitted to revalue property, plant and equipment whereas entities applying EU-adopted IFRS could do so. Retaining the options that existed in previous accounting standards would reduce transitional costs and ease transition between the different standards and also with EU-adopted IFRS. The inability to include borrowing costs as part of the costs of property, plant and equipment may cause some housing associations to breach the terms and conditions of current financing arrangements. In response to these concerns it was noted that some pragmatism was required in determining what amendments were to be made to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard and a set of guidelines was developed to assist in the process. These guidelines were as follows: changes were made to permit accounting treatments that exist in FRSs at the transition date that align with EU-adopted IFRS; changes were consistent with EU-adopted IFRS unless a non-IFRS-based solution clearly better met the objective of providing high-quality understandable financial reporting proportionate to the size and complexity of the entity and the usersâ€™ information needs. In these cases elements of an IFRS-based solution may nevertheless have been retained; use was made, where possible, of existing exemptions in company law to avoid gold-plating; and changes were made to
