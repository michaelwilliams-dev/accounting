significant levels of uncertainty. Therefore, an awareness of the presence of uncertainty can assist the auditor in identifying when they may need to exercise professional judgement. Certain aspects of a situation may be more uncertain than others; for example, some information sources may be more or less reliable than others. An appreciation of this may allow the auditor to direct their work efforts in a more effective way. Many biases involve putting undue trust in or weight on certain decisions or pieces of information; appropriately understanding the uncertainty attached to such decisions or pieces of information may help improve the quality of the judgement process. When carrying out a step in the judgement process, it is unlikely that the auditor is able to eliminate all uncertainty that may be present. By being aware of this, the auditor may be able to build in mitigating actions into their judgement process, such as considering the need to return to earlier judgement steps when new information comes to light. Example An audit manager is resourcing an engagement and is exercising their professional judgement in determining when staff will be required to be staffed. Based on his previous experience of audits with similar reporting deadlines and anecdotal feedback from colleagues who had worked on prior year audits for this audited entity, he comes to a decision about when they believe the audited entity will provide the bulk of the required information for the audit. Unfortunately, the manager is overconfident in his ability to make this decision. This causes him to not build in any contingencies in the resourcing plan or carry out further information gathering activities to support his decision. In fact, the management of the audited entity had reorganised their finance team in the year which caused some delays in the year end
