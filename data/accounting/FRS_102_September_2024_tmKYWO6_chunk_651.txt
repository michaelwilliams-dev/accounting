transaction. It was considered necessary to incorporate these details into FRS 102 to be used in conjunction with Section 2 Concepts and Pervasive Principles and Section 21 Provisions and Contingencies. B34G.2 The issue was particularly important because many PBEs provide funding on an on-going basis and there is little guidance on how such multi-year commitments should be recognised. B34G.3 Consideration was given to when a liability for such a commitment should be recognised and an entity shall only recognise a liability if the commitment to provide funding was made unconditionally, and the grantor could not realistically withdraw from the commitment. In this situation, an entity would recognise a liability for the present value of the total funding promised. B34G.4 As this is an application of the principles in Section 2 and Section 21, it was concluded that the requirements for funding commitments should apply to all entities and not just PBEs. Incoming Resources from Non-exchange Transactions B34I.1 The receipt of resources from non-exchange transactions is an inflow of resources that is highly significant for many PBEs: the receipt of donations, grants and legacies from non-exchange transactions is a major source of their funding and this issue is not addressed in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard apart from in Section 24 Government Grants. B34I.2 FRS 102 requires, in principle, PBEs to value the resources they receive from non-exchange transactions at their fair value. Consideration was given to whether using fair value would overstate the value of a donation when the entity is unable to exploit an asset fully, and the equivalent service potential could be derived from a lower value asset. Being able to achieve the same service potential from a lower value asset might suggest that the value of the donated asset should be at the lower value. However,
