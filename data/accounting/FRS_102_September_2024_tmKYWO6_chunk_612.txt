single framework for lessee accounting that provides a more faithful representation of leasing transactions and therefore provides more useful information to users of financial statements about the assets and liabilities arising from an entityâ€™s leasing transactions. For lessee accounting, IFRS 16 removed the classification of leases as either operating or finance leases by introducing a single model for all leases (subject to recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets) requiring them to be presented on the balance sheet in the form of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Lessor accounting was not changed significantly. B20.5 Stakeholder feedback received by the FRC during the Periodic Review 2024 indicated that many stakeholders supported the principle of bringing operating leases on- balance sheet. However, stakeholders identified challenges in making the IFRS 16 model proportionate for the broad range of preparers which apply FRS 102. B20.6 Some entities applying FRS 102 may be members of a group that applies IFRS Accounting Standards in its consolidated financial statements. Some stakeholders commented that minimising mandatory differences between the requirements of FRS 102 and those of IFRS 16 would therefore be beneficial to preparers and users, particularly for groups with entities that report under both FRS 102 and IFRS Accounting Standards, and would help aid comparability. The FRC therefore sought to introduce simplifications that would be optional rather than mandatory; an entity choosing not to take the simplifications would be expected to arrive at a lease accounting outcome which is comparable with that of IFRS 16. B20.7 To promote efficiency within groups, the transitional arrangements permit both first-time adopters applying Section 35 Transition to this FRS, and existing FRS 102 preparers applying Section 1, to use lease liabilities and right-of-use assets previously calculated under IFRS 16 for group reporting purposes as opening balances
