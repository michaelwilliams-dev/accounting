are necessarily incurred to generate the cash inflows from continuing use of the asset (including cash outflows to prepare the asset for use) and can be directly attributed, or allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis, to the asset; and net cash flows, if any, expected to be received (or paid) for the disposal of the asset at the end of its useful life in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. The entity may wish to use any recent financial budgets or forecasts to estimate the cash flows, if available. To estimate cash flow projections beyond the period covered by the most recent budgets or forecasts an entity may wish to extrapolate the projections based on the budgets or forecasts using a steady or declining growth rate for subsequent years, unless an increasing rate can be justified. Estimates of future cash flows shall not include: cash inflows or outflows from financing activities; or income tax receipts or payments. Future cash flows shall be estimated for the asset in its current condition. Estimates of future cash flows shall not include estimated future cash inflows or outflows that are expected to arise from: a future restructuring to which an entity is not yet committed; or improving or enhancing the asset’s performance. The discount rate (rates) used in the present value calculation shall be a pre-tax rate (rates) that reflect(s) current market assessments of: the time value of money; and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. The discount rate (rates) used to measure an asset’s value in use shall not reflect risks for which the future cash flow estimates have been adjusted, to avoid double-counting. A For assets held for their service potential, a cash flow driven valuation (such as
