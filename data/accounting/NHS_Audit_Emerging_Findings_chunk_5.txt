In accordance with the Act and delegated legislation, to audit NHS Trusts and ICBs, audit firms must be a registered local audit firm,10 with key audit partners (KAPs) to sign off audits. While Foundation Trust audits are not subject to the same requirements, in practice it is local audit firms who conduct these audits.11 There are currently 106 registered KAPs. Ninety KAPs have signed off NHS audits in the past year. We have been told that three of these will not be active in NHS audits for 2024/25. Two Responsible Individuals (RIs), who are not also KAPs, have also signed off Foundation Trust audits in the past year. 10 See the Local Audit (Delegation of Functions) and Statutory Audit (Delegation of Functions) Order 2014 and the FRC�s Local Auditors (Registration)
