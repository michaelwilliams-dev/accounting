section, as described in paragraphs 34.5 and 34.9. Measurement – fair value model An entity applying the fair value model shall measure a biological asset on initial recognition and at each reporting date at its fair value less costs to sell. Changes in fair value less costs to sell shall be recognised in profit or loss. Agricultural produce harvested from an entity’s biological assets shall be measured at the point of harvest at its fair value less costs to sell. Such measurement becomes the cost at that date for the purposes of applying Section 13 or another applicable section of this FRS. Section 2A Fair Value Measurement provides guidance on fair value measurement. The application of valuation techniques in accordance with paragraphs 2A.15 to 2A.18 may involve sector benchmarks such as the value of an orchard expressed per export tray, bushel, or hectare, or the value of cattle expressed per kilogram of meat. A If the fair value of a biological asset cannot be measured reliably, the entity shall apply the cost model to that biological asset in accordance with paragraphs 34.8 and 34.10 until such time that the fair value can be reliably measured. Disclosures – fair value model An entity shall disclose the following for each class of biological asset measured using the fair value model: a description of each class of biological asset. (b) the methods and significant assumptions applied in determining the fair value of each class of biological asset. (c) a reconciliation of changes in the carrying amount of each class of biological asset between the beginning and the end of the current period. The reconciliation shall include: * (i) the gain or loss arising from changes in fair value less costs to sell; increases resulting from purchases; decreases attributable to sales; decreases resulting from
