102 paragraphs 17.4 and 2.27)| Therefore, FRS 102 explicitly makes the link between at item of property, plant and equipment and the need for future economic benefits to flow to the entity, but this is unlikely to have much impact in practice. Initial measurement Cost FRS 15|FRS 102| Requires a tangible fixed asset to be measured initially at cost. Cost includes those costs that are directly attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use. (FRS 15 paragraphs 6) Examples of directly attributable costs include: acquisition costs; the cost of site preparation and clearance; initial delivery and handling costs; installation costs; professional fees; the estimated cost of dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site, to the extent that it is recognised as a provision. (FRS 15 paragraph 10) If the entity chooses an accounting policy of capitalising finance costs, the cost of the construction of a tangible fixed asset may include finance costs. (FRS 15 paragraph 19)|The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises the following: its purchase price; any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management including site preparation, initial delivery and handling, installation and assembly, and testing of functionality; the initial estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period; and any borrowing costs capitalised. (FRS 102 paragraph 17.10)| In practice there is no difference in the cost that would be capitalised under FRS 15
