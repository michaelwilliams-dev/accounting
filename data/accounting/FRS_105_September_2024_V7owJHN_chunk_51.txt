the cash price available at the date of purchase is recognised as interest and accounted for in accordance with paragraph 9.14(a). Costs of conversion The costs of conversion of inventories include costs directly related to the units of production, such as direct labour. They also include a systematic allocation of fixed and variable production overheads that are incurred in converting materials into finished goods. Fixed production overheads are those indirect costs of production that remain relatively constant regardless of the volume of production, such as depreciation and maintenance of factory buildings and equipment, and the cost of factory management and administration. Variable production overheads are those indirect costs of production that vary directly, or nearly directly, with the volume of production, such as indirect materials and indirect labour. Production overheads include the costs for obligations (recognised and measured in accordance with Section 16 Provisions and Contingencies) for dismantling, removing and restoring a site on which an item of property, plant and equipment is located that are incurred during the reporting period as a consequence of having used that item of property, plant and equipment to produce inventory during that period. Allocation of production overheads A micro-entity shall allocate fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion on the basis of the normal capacity of the production facilities. Normal capacity is the production expected to be achieved on average over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances, taking into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance. The actual level of production may be used if it approximates normal capacity. The amount of fixed overhead allocated to each unit of production is not increased as a consequence of low production or idle plant. Unallocated overheads are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
