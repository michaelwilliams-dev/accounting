skills for example critical thinking and handling difficult conversations. Key to this is having the time and space to coach auditors by working collaboratively with them, sharing feedback and identifying opportunities for them to be exposed to instances of scepticism and challenge in real-time work situations. Consistently communicating and prompting desired audit behaviour: An ongoing, consistent commitment to scepticism and challenge to ensure that a focus on these desired behaviours is not a one-off exercise but continually communicated and reinforced, through both formal and written informal verbal communications, even during busy periods, through regular ad hoc communication, praise and feedback. This should also be supported by the implementation of an overall culture of continual improvement. Role modelling desired audit behaviour: Senior auditors (especially partners) acting as leaders in relation to scepticism and challenge, modelling these behaviours themselves and creating opportunities for audit managers and junior level auditors to see them doing so in action and learn ‘by osmosis’, and continually reasserting the behaviours in communications and feedback. The research also highlighted a number of recurring themes in respect of the factors that can impede firms from establishing a culture that encourages auditors to consistently display behaviours linked to high quality audit if they are not in place: Resources to enable desired auditor behaviour: Time, workload and resourcing pressures are felt to squeeze out the time and space needed for auditors to be able to exercise scepticism and challenge, and apply the critical thinking needed for good judgement. Such pressures act to disincentivise these behaviours for fear of delays and put additional unnecessary stress on auditors, and in aggregate, the audit industry. Workplace environments that support desired auditor behaviour: Environments that discourage or fail to promote open, collaborative working practices can be damaging to the ability of auditors to show the
