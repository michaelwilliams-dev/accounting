you like, and by as many months as you like. However, there are restrictions on extending accounting reference periods. You cannot extend a period so that it lasts more than 18 months from the start date of the accounting period (unless the company is in administration). You may not extend more than once in 5 years unless: the company is in administration the Secretary of State has approved this the company is aligning its accounting reference date with that of a subsidiary or parent undertaking under the law of the UK There are no additional restrictions when changing your company�s first ARD. Many companies make the mistake of simply adding 6 months to the end of the period - which can sometimes extend the period beyond 18 months and lead to the application being rejected. When you extend your first accounting period to the maximum 18 months, you must count the date of incorporation as the first day of the period. 2. Accounting records Every company must keep accounting records - whether they are trading, or not. Accounting records must include: entries showing all money received and expended by the company a record of the assets and liabilities of the company Also, if your company�s business involves dealing in goods, the records must include: statements of stock held by the company at the end of each financial year all statements of stock takings from which you have taken or prepared any statements of stock statements of all goods sold and purchased, other than by ordinary retail trade. This should list the goods, the buyers and sellers Parent companies must ensure that any subsidiary undertaking keeps su?cient accounting records so that the directors of the parent company can prepare accounts that comply with the Companies Act or UK-adopted International Accounting Standards.
