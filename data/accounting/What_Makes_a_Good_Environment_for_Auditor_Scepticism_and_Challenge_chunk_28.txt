of the quality of management at the audited entity including the extent to which directors are open to challenge and value audit quality. Where the audit firm has any concerns, these should be raised with the audit committee and appropriate action taken. Good practice – audit committees & management| “Some firms conducted post-audit interviews to collect feedback from audited entities’ management and audit committees focusing on audit quality, effective challenge and the delivery of audit and project management.” “One firm created an audit committee effectiveness framework to enable the self-assessment on the effectiveness of the audit committee.” “One firm produced a guidance video to outline what audited entities’ management should expect from the audit process, including scepticism and challenge.” “One firm invited an experienced Audit Committee Chair to share perspectives on what effective challenge of management by auditors means to them in its annual audit training to the post- qualified auditors.” “At one firm, the audit committee chair asked for a discussion with the engagement team, without the senior leadership of the team, to understand the culture of the team and how they demonstrated the behaviours. During the discussion the audit committee chair asked lots of questions about how the team challenged management, the areas of challenge, and how the team challenged themselves on the audit approach.”| Appendix 1: Tier 1, 2 and 3 Audit Firms The seven audit firms defined as being Tier 1 are: BDO LLP (“BDO”)|KPMG LLP (“KPMG”)| Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”)|Mazars LLP (“Mazars”)| Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”)|PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”)| Grant Thornton UK LLP (“GT”)|| Tier 2 & 3 Firms as defined by the FRC for 2022/23 are: Crowe U.K. LLP|Gerald Edelman LLP| Haysmacintyre LLP|Hazlewoods LLP| Macintyre Hudson LLP|Jeffreys Henry Audit Limited| PKF Littlejohn LLP|Johnsons Financial Management Ltd| RSM UK Audit LLP|UHY Hacker Young LLP| Anstey Bond
