amount deductible from payments to subcontractors to our accounts oﬃce monthly. They must pay deductions due to be made in each tax month within 14 days of the end of that month or within 17 days where payment is made electronically, whether or not these deductions have actually been made. This means that where a required deduction has not actually been made from the subcontractor’s payment, for whatever reason, the contractor is still responsible for paying that amount over to us. Contractors may also have to pay penalties if they do not pay the amounts due on time and in full. Example Deductions made between 6 May and 5 June must be paid by 19 June, or by 22 June where payment is made electronically (or the previous banking day where the 22nd is a weekend or bank holiday). Make sure you use the correct payslip for the month in question. If the contractor also has PAYE employees, the contractor must make a payment to our accounts oﬃce that includes both the subcontractors’ deductions and the PAYE or National Insurance contributions deducted. A contractor whose average monthly payments to the accounts oﬃce (including, where applicable, PAYE and National Insurance contributions deductions from employees) are below £1,500, may choose to pay quarterly. The quarters end on 5 July, 5 October, 5 January and 5 April and payments are due within 14 days of the end of each quarter or 17 days if the contractor pays electronically. Even where payments are made on a quarterly basis, contractors must still send returns monthly — read paragraph 4.2.
