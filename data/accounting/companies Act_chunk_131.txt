executed in a part of the United Kingdom, is exempt from stamp duty. Jurisdiction of local courts A competent court in a country or territory where an overseas branch register is kept may exercise the same jurisdiction as is exercisable by a court in the United Kingdom— to rectify the register (see section 125), or in relation to a request for inspection or a copy of the register (see section 117). The offences— of refusing inspection or failing to provide a copy of the register (see section 118), and of making a false, misleading or deceptive statement in a request for inspection or a copy (see section 119), may be prosecuted summarily before any tribunal having summary criminal jurisdiction in the country or territory where the register is kept. This section extends only to those countries and territories to which paragraph 3 of Schedule 14 to the Companies Act 1985 (c. 6) (which made similar provision) extended immediately before the coming into force of this Chapter. Discontinuance of overseas branch register A company may discontinue an overseas branch register. If it does so all the entries in that register must be transferred— to some other overseas branch register kept in the same country or territory, or to the main register. The company must give notice to the registrar within 14 days of the discontinuance. If default is made in complying with subsection (3), an offence is committed by— the company, and every officer of the company who is in default. A person guilty of an offence under subsection (4) is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale and, for continued contravention, a daily default fine not exceeding one-tenth of level 3 on the standard scale.
