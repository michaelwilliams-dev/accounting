audits, there is an unacceptable gap in audit quality between the PIE audits conducted by Tier 2 and Tier 3 firms and those conducted by Tier 1 firms. The FRC wishes to see a more resilient market with a pipeline of firms capable of entering and growing in the PIE audit market, including taking on audits of greater complexity, while performing high-quality audits. However, firms tell us that they do not understand enough about what good looks like and that they feel daunted by the FRCâ€™s regulatory approach. To address these challenges we are increasing our support for Tier 2 and Tier 3 firms and expanding it to firms that are looking to enter the PIE audit market (which we refer to as Tier 4). A key element of this additional support is the Audit Firm Scalebox, which we announced in December 2022. We are launching the Scalebox project along with this publication. We are also developing additional ways to drive quality improvements, by sharing more good practice and forward-looking insights from our work at all firms. High-quality audit requires all elements of the audit ecosystem to be functioning effectively. At the same time as calling on audit firms to rise to the challenge of conducting high-quality audits, we also call on the preparers of financial statements, to focus on producing high-quality information, and on their Audit Committees to focus on prioritising audit quality. The firms at whom this publication is aimed often rely on third-party service providers to conduct quality control and other functions and we also call on such providers to ensure that their services meet the quality standards that we expect. 1 In the UK, PIEs are defined in Section 494A of the Companies Act 2006 and Regulation 2 of The Statutory Auditors and Third Country Auditors
