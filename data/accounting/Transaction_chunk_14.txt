is not sent the Transaction Engine will automatically delete the resources related to the CorrelationID within 60 days. To signify it has processed a Business Error response message it obtained (by polling) from the Transaction Engine. If the DELETE_REQUEST message is not sent the Transaction Engine will automatically delete the resources related to the CorrelationID within 30 days. The CorrelationID specifies the message to be deleted from the Transaction Engine. The Class must match the Class value that was obtained in the Business/Business Error response (or SUBMISSION_ERROR that returned the CorrelationID). When performing a DELETE_REQUEST the Transaction Engine checks if the given Class matches that stored in the Transaction Engine for that particular correlationID – if no match is found an error will be returned. In response to the DELETE_REQUEST message, the Transaction Engine can return either a DELETE_RESPONSE or a SUBMISSION_ERROR message. If the client receives a SUBMISSION_ERROR message it must process any standard errors in the normal way and then reissue the DELETE_REQUEST message. If the error indicates the CorrelationID cannot be found (typically error code 2000) then the client can cease sending the DELETE_REQUEST message. Note: If the client issues a DELETE_REQUEST message before a Business/Business Error response or SUBMISSION_RESPONSE has been returned from the Transaction Engine the resources associated with the transaction on the Transaction Engine will be removed. This will not prevent the original submission from being sent to the backend system – there are no associated recall semantics. If the client issues this request the implication is that the client no longer wishes to progress the submission via the Transaction Engine and will reconcile the transaction through some other means.
