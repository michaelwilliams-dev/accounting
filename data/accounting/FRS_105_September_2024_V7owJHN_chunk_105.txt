recoverable amount of the individual asset, a micro-entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. This may be the case because measuring the recoverable amount requires forecasting cash flows, and sometimes individual assets do not generate cash flows by themselves. An impairment loss for a cash-generating unit shall be recognised and measured in accordance with the relevant requirements of Section 27 Impairment of Assets of FRS 102. A micro-entity that has goodwill acquired in a business combination shall apply the additional impairment requirements applicable to goodwill in paragraphs 27.24 to 27.27 of FRS 102. A micro-entity shall recognise an impairment loss immediately in profit or loss. Indicators of impairment A micro-entity shall assess at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the micro-entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. If there is no indication of impairment, it is not necessary to estimate the recoverable amount. In assessing whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired, a micro-entity shall consider, as a minimum, the following indications: External sources of information During the period, an asset’s market value has declined significantly more than would be expected as a result of the passage of time or normal use. Significant changes with an adverse effect on the micro-entity have taken place during the period, or will take place in the near future, in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the micro-entity operates or in the market to which an asset is dedicated. Market interest rates or other market rates of return on investments have increased during the period, and those increases are likely to affect materially the discount rate used in calculating an asset’s value in use
