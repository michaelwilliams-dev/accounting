section. Financial statements Financial statements of a micro-entity are prepared for a specified period of time (reporting period) and provide information about: assets and liabilities – including unrecognised assets and liabilities – and equity that existed at the end of the reporting period, or during the reporting period; and income and expenses for the reporting period. To help users of the financial statements of micro-entities to identify and assess changes and trends, financial statements also provide comparative information for at least one preceding reporting period, except when this FRS permits or requires otherwise. Information about possible future transactions and other possible future events is included in financial statements if it: relates to the micro-entity’s assets or liabilities – including unrecognised assets or liabilities – or equity that existed at the end of the reporting period, or during the reporting period, or to income or expenses for the reporting period; and is useful to users of financial statements. Financial statements do not typically provide other types of forward-looking information, for example, explanatory material about management’s expectations and strategies for the micro-entity. Perspective adopted in financial statements Financial statements provide information about transactions and other events viewed from the perspective of the micro-entity as a whole. Going concern assumption Financial statements are normally prepared on the assumption that the micro-entity is a going concern and will continue in operation for the foreseeable future. However, if management either intends to liquidate the entity or cease trading, or has no realistic alternative but to do so, the financial statements shall be prepared on a different basis. The elements of financial statements The elements of financial statements defined in this section are: assets, liabilities and equity, which relate to a micro-entity’s financial position; and income and expenses, which relate to a micro-entity’s financial performance.
