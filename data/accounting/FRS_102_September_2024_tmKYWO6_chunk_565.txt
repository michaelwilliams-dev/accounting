from applying the amendments. Transitional arrangements were provided to: permit entities to carry forward fair value as deemed cost for an investment property that is rented to another group entity, when it is to be measured based on cost going forward – this made a choice available that would have existed on first-time adoption of FRS 102 if this investment property had not been measured at fair value in the meantime (previous UK and Ireland accounting standards would not have regarded such a property as an investment property); and require entities to continue to recognise separately any intangible assets separated from goodwill in business combinations effected since transition to FRS 102. UK exit from the European Union (December 2020) In January 2020 the UK exited the European Union. As a result, changes were required to UK company law to ensure that it continues to operate effectively. FRS 102 was amended in December 2020 to reflect these changes. This included amending the references to ‘EU-adopted IFRS’ to read ‘adopted IFRS’, which incorporates the accounting standards referred to in both UK and Irish company law (UK-adopted international accounting standards and EU-adopted IFRS, respectively). Early application is permitted by entities in the UK, which is consistent with the transitional arrangement provided in UK company law for entities preparing ‘IAS accounts’. Application of the amendments to an accounting period beginning before 1 January 2021 allows entities to use international accounting standards that are adopted for use within the UK after 31 December 2020 in their individual accounts, which may be relevant when FRS 102 permits or requires the application of a specific IFRS Accounting Standard (as adopted in the relevant jurisdiction). Periodic Review 2024 FRSs are subject to periodic reviews to consider stakeholder feedback, changes in IFRS Accounting Standards and the IFRS for SMEs
