Directors may make their own assessment of equivalence in determining whether the company qualifies for the exemption, following the principle in section 300 of the Companies Act 2014 and this Application Guidance. The condition in section 300(4)(b) subparagraph (iv) AG17 A mechanism to determine the equivalence to EU-adopted IFRS of the GAAPs of third countries was established in 2007.15 Subsequently, the European Commission has identified as equivalent to EU-adopted IFRS the following: GAAP|Applicable from| IFRS as issued by the IASB16|1 January 2009| GAAP of Japan|1 January 2009| GAAP of the United States of America|1 January 2009| GAAP of the People’s Republic of China|1 January 2012| GAAP of Canada|1 January 2012| GAAP of the Republic of Korea|1 January 2012| AG18 At the date of publication of this FRS, the equivalence of FRS 102 or UK-adopted international accounting standards to EU-adopted IFRS has not been formally determined under the mechanism referred to in paragraph AG17.
