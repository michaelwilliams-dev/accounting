recent previous financial statements in conformity with FRS 101; or presented its most recent previous financial statements in conformity with FRS 105. Paragraph 3.17 defines a complete set of financial statements. Paragraph 3.14 requires an entity to disclose, in a complete set of financial statements, comparative information in respect of the preceding period for all amounts presented in the financial statements, as well as specified comparative narrative and descriptive information. An entity may present comparative information in respect of more than one preceding period. Therefore, an entityâ€™s date of transition to this FRS is the beginning of the earliest period for which the entity presents full comparative information in accordance with this FRS in its first financial statements that comply with this FRS. 58 This excludes interim financial statements. Procedures for preparing financial statements at the date of transition Except as provided in paragraphs 35.9 to 35.11B, an entity shall, in its opening statement of financial position as of its date of transition to this FRS (ie the beginning of the earliest period presented): recognise all assets and liabilities whose recognition is required by this FRS; not recognise items as assets or liabilities if this FRS does not permit such recognition; reclassify items that it recognised under its previous financial reporting framework as one type of asset, liability or component of equity, but are a different type of asset, liability or component of equity under this FRS; and apply this FRS in measuring all recognised assets and liabilities. This section does not require the opening statement of financial position to be presented. The accounting policies that an entity uses in its opening statement of financial position under this FRS may differ from those that it used for the same date using its previous financial reporting framework. The resulting adjustments arise
