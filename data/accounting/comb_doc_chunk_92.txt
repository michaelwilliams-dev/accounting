Investment properties (i) FRS 102 requires all investment properties that are not rented to another group entity to be measured at fair value, with gains and losses recognised in profit or loss. Under its previous financial reporting framework, Entity X was not required to measure investment property at fair value on the balance sheet. Instead investment property was measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. At 1 January 2018, the carrying amount of the investment property was CU1,000,000 and its fair value was measured at CU3,800,000 resulting in a fair value gain of CU2,800,000 on transition. At 31 December 2018, the carrying amount was CU960,000 and the fair value of the property had increased further to CU4.41m. An adjustment of CU3,450.000 is required to the balance sheet along with an adjustment to remove depreciation of CU40,000 from administrative expenses and a fair value gain of CU610,000 recognised in the profit and loss in the year. This example ignores deferred tax, but a deferred tax liability would usually be recognised in relation to the fair value gain on the investment property. Key FRS 102 references Suggested presentation of reconciliations Key FRS 102 references Other transitional disclosures FRS 102 contains an overarching requirement to explain how the transition to FRS 102 has affected its reported financial position and performance. An entity also needs to provide a description of the nature of each change in accounting policy. FRS 102
