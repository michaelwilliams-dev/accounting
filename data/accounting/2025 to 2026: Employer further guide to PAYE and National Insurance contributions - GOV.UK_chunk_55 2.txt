If payments are due to be paid during a holiday period, the National Insurance contributions due on the payment are dependent on how National Insurance contributions were worked out on the holiday pay for the week in which payment is due to be made. For example, an employee is due to be paid for overtime worked but because of the payroll arrangements the overtime does not become payable until the employee is on holiday. If method A was used to work out National Insurance contributions on the holiday pay, regardless of the week in which the payment is actually made: treat the payment as belonging to the week in which it would normally have been made (had the employee not been on holiday) add the payment to the holiday pay due for that week work out National Insurance contributions on the total take into account the National Insurance contributions already paid on the holiday pay for that week adjust the employeeÕs payroll record to reßect the correct National Insurance contributions Þgures However, if the payment is actually made in a di " erent tax year from the one in which it was due to be made, work out National Insurance contributions separately on the payment based on the contribution rates and limits current at the time of payment. If method B was used to work out National Insurance contributions on the holiday pay, and if payment is: actually made in the week in which it was due to be made treat it separately from the holiday pay due for that week and work out National Insurance contributions on it in the normal way made at a later date for example, when the employee returns to work, add it to the payment due for that period and work out National Insurance contributions on the total Examples These examples are based on 2025 to 2026 contribution rates and limits for an employee paying National Insurance contributions under category letter A. National Insurance contributions are worked out using the exact percentage method. On 31 July the employee is paid basic wages for working 25 July to 29 July of £400, plus holiday pay for 31 July to 5 August of £200, plus holiday pay for 6 August to 12 August of £200. This totals £800. On 19 August the employee is paid basic wages for working 15 August to 19 August of £4 0 0 . The employee worked overtime during the week 25 July and was due to receive the overtime payment of £100 on 6 August.
