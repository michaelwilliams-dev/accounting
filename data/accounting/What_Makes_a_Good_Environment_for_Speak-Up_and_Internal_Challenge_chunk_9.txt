exchanges between team members. Across the audit profession there is also a consistent narrative that feeds a ‘culture of busy’, and this invariably poses a significant barrier to speaking up and challenging. Inclusion is another factor which significantly influences the propensity for speaking up. Human behaviour studies explain that the safety to speak up or challenge follows a progression based on the natural sequence of human needs of which inclusion (acceptance) is the first level. Once this is in place people will feel safe to learn and then feel able to contribute. The safety to challenge or speak up can be achieved only after all these aspects are in place. Measurement Continual review of the speak-up culture and understanding the drivers and barriers to speaking up can identify key themes of poor behaviour as well as indicating areas where there is a risk of such behaviour developing. Firms will be able to respond to these themes and risks with initiatives designed to drive a change in behaviour. Continuous assessment It is imperative to get a holistic view when assessing speak-up culture by using both qualitative and quantitative measurements. For example, before celebrating a low volume of reports as a victory, consideration should be given to the possibility that low report volume can be linked to reporter anxiety and mistrust of the firm’s speak-up programme. Assessing how safe people feel to ask questions, share ideas and concerns, and challenge those more senior to them, is not a straightforward exercise. However, designing methods to collect this evidence will greatly enhance a firm’s insight into the psychological safety within teams to speak up and challenge internally. A further benefit of such data would be the indication of typical challenges team members of different levels face which can then be used as input into
