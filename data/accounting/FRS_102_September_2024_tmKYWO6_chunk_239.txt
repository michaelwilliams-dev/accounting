If payment is deferred beyond normal credit terms, the cost is the present value of all future payments. Exchanges of assets An item of property, plant or equipment may be acquired in exchange for a non-monetary asset or assets, or a combination of monetary and non-monetary assets. An entity shall measure the cost of the acquired asset at fair value unless: the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance; or the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable. In that case, the assetâ€™s cost is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up. Subsequent measurement An entity shall measure all items of property, plant and equipment after initial recognition using the cost model (in accordance with paragraph 17.15A) or the revaluation model (in accordance with paragraphs 17.15B to 17.15F). Where the revaluation model is selected, this shall be applied to all items of property, plant and equipment in the same class of asset (ie having a similar nature, function or use in the business). An entity shall recognise the costs of day-to-day servicing of an item of property, plant and equipment in profit or loss in the period in which the costs are incurred. Cost model 17.15A Under the cost model, an entity shall measure an item of property, plant and equipment at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Revaluation model 17.15B Under the revaluation model, an item of property, plant and equipment whose fair value can be measured reliably shall be carried at a revalued amount, being its fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Revaluations shall be made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be
