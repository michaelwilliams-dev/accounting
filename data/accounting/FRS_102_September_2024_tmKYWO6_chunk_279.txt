obligation for those costs. This may occur at the commencement date or subsequently. A lessee applies Section 13 Inventories to costs that are incurred during a particular period as a consequence of having used the right-of-use asset to produce inventories during that period. The obligations for such costs accounted for applying this section or Section 13 are recognised and measured applying Section 21. Initial measurement of the lease liability At the commencement date, a lessee shall measure the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The lease payments shall be discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee shall choose, on a lease-by-lease basis, to apply either the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate or the lessee’s obtainable borrowing rate. PBE20.50 A public benefit entity that is unable readily to determine either the interest rate implicit in the lease, or the lessee’s incremental or obtainable borrowing rate for a lease, shall use the rate of interest otherwise obtainable by the public benefit entity on deposits held with financial institutions. At the commencement date, the lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following payments for the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term that are not paid at the commencement date: fixed payments (including in-substance fixed lease payments as described in paragraph 20.52), less any lease incentives receivable; variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date (as described in paragraphs 20.53 and 20.54); amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; the exercise price of a purchase option if
