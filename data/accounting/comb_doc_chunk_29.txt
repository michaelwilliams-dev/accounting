Threats to independence The auditor carries out an assessment to determine whether providing restructuring services to the PIE would pose a risk to independence. In doing so, the auditor needs to consider how the provision of such a service would be viewed by an objective, reasonable and informed third party. If such a third party would be likely to conclude that the actual or perceived independence of the auditor would be affected, then the auditor should not accept the engagement. To avoid certain potential threats to independence, appropriate engagement conditions that should exist and that the engagement letter issued by the auditor for each restructuring services engagement provided to a participating PIE should incorporate, include that: The auditorâ€™s role is advisory only; The loan conditions are set by the lead lending institution; The restructuring services cannot be tailored for the specific participating PIE; The loan is managed by the syndicate which will also negotiate final terms and conditions with the debtor2; and The auditor has no authority to bind or transact for the lending institution. 2 Noting that when acting for a syndicate the service provider may be used to communicate options for terms and conditions from participants, however, this cannot bind the participants.

This can happen where a participant PIE acts either as the agent or a member of the steering committee of a lending syndicate or is able to exert significant influence by virtue of its share of the debt held.3 We believe the consideration of risks to independence outlined above
