such as revenue, trade receivables and trade payables, and in the cash flow statement, so nothing is being hidden from the intended users.|The engagement partner accepts that this is a relevant consideration to how intended users might evaluate the net debt figure. In particular, it may be possible for a user to “connect the dots” and understand that net debt may increase significantly soon after year end. However, there are many and varied other factors that influence the levels of these various balances, so it may be highly difficult to actually trace the connection. Furthermore, it may be the case that the users pay more attention to net debt figures than some other balance sheet metrics.| The engagement partner also asks her engagement team to look at the capital management disclosures of similar companies, in an effort to understand whether any peer companies provide information on how net debt had moved throughout the period; this is important in understanding what needs and expectations the intended users might have regarding this disclosure. The team find that some companies do provide such information, for example disclosing the average net debt for the year. She consults with an internal technical panel of partners who have greater experience in how the intended users of F plc’s financial statements might interpret and use the relevant disclosure. They advise that net debt levels and capital structure ratios do indeed commonly influence investment decisions in this sector, and that there is diversity regarding the extent to which investors take the time to look at other balance sheet metrics with similar interest. The engagement partner notes that the change in net debt at year end is many times materiality, so if she decides that the disclosure is misstated, it is likely materially misstated.
