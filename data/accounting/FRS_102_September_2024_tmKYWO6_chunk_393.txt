case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the measurement of termination benefits shall be based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. When termination benefits are due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period, they shall be measured at their discounted present value using the methodology for selecting a discount rate specified in paragraph 28.17. Group plans When an entity participates in a defined benefit plan that shares risks between entities under common control it shall obtain information about the plan as a whole measured in accordance with this FRS on the basis of assumptions that apply to the plan as a whole. If there is a contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost of a defined benefit plan as a whole measured in accordance with this FRS to individual group entities, the entity shall, in its individual financial statements, recognise the net defined benefit cost of a defined benefit plan so charged. If there is no such agreement or policy, the net defined benefit cost of a defined benefit plan shall be recognised in the individual financial statements of the group entity which is the sponsoring employer for the plan. The other group entities shall, in their individual financial statements, recognise a cost equal to their contribution payable for the period. As the net defined benefit cost is calculated by reference to both the defined obligation and the fair value of plan assets, recognising a net defined benefit cost requires the recognition of a corresponding net defined benefit asset or liability in the individual financial statements of any group entity recognising a net defined benefit cost.
