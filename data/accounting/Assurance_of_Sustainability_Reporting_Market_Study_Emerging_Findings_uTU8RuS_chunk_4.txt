2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 ISAE 3000 is the most commonly used assurance standard for FTSE 350 sustainability assurance engagements In 2022, 56% of FTSE 350 assurance engagements used the ISAE 3000 standard compared to 71% in the FTSE 100. Use of ISAE 3000 rose by 5 percentage points among FTSE 350 companies between 2019 and 2022, but a larger increase of 9 percentage points was seen in the FTSE 100. The use of ISO 14064 and AA 1000 remained relatively consistent between 2019 and 2022 among both FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies. Note: For each assurance opinion, more than one assurance standard can be applied, so the total may exceed 100% in any year. Market trends – level of assurance Limited assurance is the most common level obtained by FTSE 350 companies In 2022, 75% (152) of FTSE 350 assurance engagements included limited assurance over some, or all, of the metrics being assured. Higher levels of assurance (either moderate* or reasonable) appear to be more common, as a proportion of engagements using that standard, when non-ISAE assurance standards are used. *Moderate assurance is only applicable under AA 1000. Under other assurance standards, such as ISAE 3000, this would constitute limited assurance. Note: More than one assurance standard may be applied in an assurance engagement; for example, ISAE 3000 and ISAE 3410 are often applied together.
