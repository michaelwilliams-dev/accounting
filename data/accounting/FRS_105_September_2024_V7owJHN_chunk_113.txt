if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The amount of the post-employment benefits received by the employee is determined by the amount of contributions paid by a micro-entity (and perhaps also the employee) to a post-employment benefit plan or to an insurer, together with investment returns arising from the contributions. Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under defined benefit plans, the micro-entity’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by the micro-entity. If actuarial or investment experience is worse than expected, the micro-entity’s obligation may be increased, and vice versa if actuarial or investment experience is better than expected. Post-employment benefit plans Recognition and measurement – requirements applicable to all plans When contributions to a defined contribution or defined benefit plan are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the reporting period in which the employees render the related service, the liability recognised in accordance with paragraph 23.2(a) shall be measured at the present value of the contributions payable using the methodology for selecting a discount rate specified in paragraph 23.11. The unwinding of the discount shall be recognised as interest expense in profit or loss in the period in which it arises. A micro-entity shall determine the rate used to discount the future payments by reference to market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds. In countries with no deep market in such bonds, the micro-entity shall use the market
