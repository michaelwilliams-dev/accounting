to as NHS bodies in this document. The scope of the study does not include other types of NHS organisations. For the financial year 2023/24 there were 211 NHS providers and 42 ICBs. The 42 ICBs were established in 2022, replacing 106 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs).3 NHS bodies sit within Integrated Care Systems (ICSs). Each ICS contains one ICB and several NHS providers, determined by geographic location.4 Since the passing of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 (the Act), NHS Trusts and ICBs (previously CCGs) have been required to procure and locally appoint their own auditors, with the process overseen by an auditor panel.5 NHS Trusts and commissioners have procured their own auditors since 2017/18.

Audits of NHS bodies are conducted in accordance with the Code of Audit Practice issued by the National Audit Office (NAO). The FRC�s Audit Quality Review (AQR) team is responsible for monitoring the quality of major local audits (MLAs). An MLA is an audit of an NHS Trust, ICB or local government body with income or expenditure of at least �500 million, or which maintains a local authority pension scheme of certain characteristics.8 The ICAEW�s Quality Assurance Department (QAD) is responsible for monitoring the quality of non-major local audits.
