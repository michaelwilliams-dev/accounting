The extent to which the auditor’s work was designed to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations.

The auditor needs to ensure that such an explanation reports matters of significance clearly and concisely, without the use of boiler plate text. In determining those matters that are of significance1, both quantitative and qualitative factors are relevant to such consideration. In explaining the extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, the auditor should consider how their approach to the audit has affected the likelihood of detection. This will be affected by the inherent difficulty in detecting them, the effectiveness of the entity’s controls, and the nature, timing and extent of the audit procedures performed. Irregularities that result from fraud might be inherently more difficult to detect than irregularities that result from error. The auditor’s responsibilities for the engagement will mean 1 Significance is defined in the FRC’s Glossary of Terms. that detection of those types of irregularity which give rise to a risk of material misstatement are those on which the auditor is able to provide the most comprehensive explanation. For example: Where the auditor has identified legislation of particular relevance to the entity, what procedures did the auditor design to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding compliance with that legislation?
