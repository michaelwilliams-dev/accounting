An entity shall not recognise revenue upon delivery of a product to another party if the delivered product is held on consignment. Indicators that an arrangement is a consignment arrangement include, but are not limited to, the following: the product is controlled by the entity until a specified event occurs, such as the sale of the product to a customer of the distributor or until a specified period expires; the entity is able to require the return of the product or transfer the product to a third party (such as another distributor); and the distributor does not have an unconditional obligation to pay for the product (although it might be required to pay a deposit).
