In periods of abnormally high production, the amount of fixed overhead allocated to each unit of production is decreased so that inventories are not measured above cost. Variable production overheads are allocated to each unit of production on the basis of the actual use of the production facilities. Other costs included in inventories A micro-entity shall include other costs in the cost of inventories only to the extent that they are incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Costs excluded from inventories Examples of costs excluded from the cost of inventories and recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred are: abnormal amounts of wasted materials, labour or other production costs; storage costs, unless those costs are necessary during the production process before a further production stage; administrative overheads that do not contribute to bringing inventories to their present location and condition; and selling costs. Cost of inventories of a service provider To the extent that service providers have inventories, they measure them at the costs of their production. These costs consist primarily of the labour and other costs of personnel directly engaged in providing the service, including supervisory personnel, and attributable overheads. Labour and other costs relating to sales and general administrative personnel are not included but are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. The cost of inventories of a service provider does not include profit margins or non-attributable overheads that are often factored into prices charged by service providers. Cost of agricultural produce harvested from biological assets Section 27 requires that inventories comprising agricultural produce that a micro-entity has harvested from its biological assets should be measured on initial recognition, at the point of harvest, at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs
