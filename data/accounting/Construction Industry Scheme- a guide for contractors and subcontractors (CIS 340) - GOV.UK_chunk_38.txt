Under the scheme, a contra does not reduce the payment from which the deduction may have to be made and is a payment by the contractor to the subcontractor. Example On a contract worth £200, a contractor gives the subcontractor some surplus materials and restricts payment by £50. The contractor must calculate the deduction on the full contract value of £200. When completing the monthly return, the contractor must show the gross payment to the subcontractor, or the amount before deduction where appropriate, in the amount of £200.

Example On a contract worth £2,000, a contractor withholds £400 because work was below standard. The contractor must calculate the deduction on £1,600. When completing the monthly return, the contractor must show the gross payment to the subcontractor, or the amount before deduction where appropriate, in the amount of £1,600.
