cost of a financial asset (liability) is the present value of future cash receipts (payments) discounted at the effective interest rate; and in the absence of capital repayments, the interest expense (income) in a period equals the carrying amount of the financial liability (asset) at the beginning of a period multiplied by the effective interest rate for the period. When calculating the effective interest rate, an entity shall estimate cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument (eg prepayment, call and similar options) and known credit losses that have been incurred, but it shall not consider possible future credit losses not yet incurred. For variable rate financial assets and variable rate financial liabilities the current market rate of interest or index of general price inflation may be used when estimating the contractual cash flows. When calculating the effective interest rate, an entity shall amortise any related fees, finance charges paid or received (such as ‘points’), transaction costs and other premiums or discounts over the expected life of the instrument, except as follows. The entity shall use a shorter period if that is the period to which the fees, finance charges paid or received, transaction costs, premiums or discounts relate. This will be the case when the variable to which the fees, finance charges paid or received, transaction costs, premiums or discounts relate is repriced to market rates before the expected maturity of the instrument. In such a case, the appropriate amortisation period is the period to the next such repricing date. For variable rate financial assets and variable rate financial liabilities, periodic re-estimation of cash flows to reflect changes in market rates of interest or an index of general price inflation alters the effective interest rate. If a variable rate financial asset or variable rate financial liability is
