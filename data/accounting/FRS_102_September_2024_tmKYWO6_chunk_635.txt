contribution plan, it shall recognise a liability for the contributions payable that arise from the agreement (to the extent that they relate to a deficit). This is the most cost-effective way of recognising the entityâ€™s obligation to employees as a result of service rendered. This contrasts with the approach for defined benefit plans because the obligation has already been recognised as the net defined benefit liability. Effect of a restriction on the recoverability of a plan surplus B28.16 Initially FRS 102 did not specify where an entity shall recognise the effects of a restriction on the recoverability of a plan surplus, and therefore FRS 102 would require it to be recognised in profit or loss. A plan surplus may be irrecoverable because the entity is not able to recover the surplus through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan (see paragraph 28.22 of FRS 102). Except for any amount included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability, the effect of any such restriction should be recognised in other comprehensive income and therefore paragraph 28.25 was amended so that any such amounts are part of remeasurements, and recognised in other comprehensive income. This is consistent with IAS 19. Disclosures B28.17 Some respondents commented that the disclosure of information about the amount and timing of payments intended to fund a deficit in a defined benefit plan would be useful information for users of financial statements. Although this was already covered by the requirement to describe the funding policy, paragraph 28.41(a) was amended to clarify this. Disclosure of the basis used to determine the limit on recognising a plan surplus B28.18 As part of the Periodic Review 2024, amendments were made to require an entity to disclose, when applicable, the basis used to determine the limit on
