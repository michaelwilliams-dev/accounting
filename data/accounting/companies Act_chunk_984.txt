treated as arising in consequence of, the sale, transfer or other disposition by the company of a non-cash asset, and any part of the amount at which that asset is stated in the relevant accounts represents an unrealised profit. That profit is treated as a realised profit— for the purpose of determining the lawfulness of the distribution in accordance with this Part (whether before or after the distribution takes place), and for the purpose of the application, in relation to anything done with a view to or in connection with the making of the distribution, of any provision of regulations under section 396 under which only realised profits are to be included in or transferred to the profit and loss account. Consequences of unlawful distribution Consequences of unlawful distribution This section applies where a distribution, or part of one, made by a company to one of its members is made in contravention of this Part. If at the time of the distribution the member knows or has reasonable grounds for believing that it is so made, he is liable— to repay it (or that part of it, as the case may be) to the company, or in the case of a distribution made otherwise than in cash, to pay the company a sum equal to the value of the distribution (or part) at that time. This is without prejudice to any obligation imposed apart from this section on a member of a company to repay a distribution unlawfully made to him. This section does not apply in relation to— financial assistance given by a company in contravention of section 678 or 679, or any payment made by a company in respect of the redemption or purchase by the company of shares in itself.
