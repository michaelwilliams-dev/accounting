The joint tribunal provisions are intended to make the Schemes more efficient and effective by streamlining procedure, facilitating consistent tribunal decision-making and ultimately reducing costs in such cases. The new provisions incorporate a number of suggestions put by respondents to the consultation process earlier this year. A consultation feedback statement is available on the FRC website.
