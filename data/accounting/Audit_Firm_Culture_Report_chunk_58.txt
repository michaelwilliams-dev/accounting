enacting behaviours, they are reliant on older training received early on in their careers which can be challenging to recall. In particular, they feel they could benefit from prompts on up-to-date definitions of scepticism and challenge and what best practice looks like in relation to both behaviours. Ineffective embedding of remote training reducing scope for informal learning Auditors across all firms and levels felt that firms had not effectively translated the benefits of coaching and other informal training around scepticism and challenge over to new ways of working since Covid-19. Many senior auditors felt that, as a result of poor embedding of remote or hybrid working practices, junior auditors can miss out on important opportunities to learn from colleagues and experience challenge for themselves. In particular, some auditors said it can feel harder to coach juniors over the phone or on video as they are less able to show them how to approach tasks or apply scepticism. Further, some mentioned that more could be done to involve juniors in ad hoc meetings with the audited entity when working remotely (e.g. inviting them to join meetings remotely), because in some cases juniors were not invited to join meetings as they were not physically available. “I won't send them a meeting invite but if they are in the room and look like they are showing willingness to be involved [I will invite a first-year associate].” (Associate / Senior associate) “Remote working makes it harder to share real-life experiences which are the ones people really remember.” (Partner) Some auditors also felt that poor embedding of remote or hybrid working practices can mean that junior auditors develop fewer soft skills which they felt are essential to effective scepticism and challenge, such as developing personal relationships, communication, listening, teamwork, and confidence, where they are increasingly
