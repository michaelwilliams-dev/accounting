about financial instruments held at fair value analysed by the level of a fair value hierarchy then set out in paragraph 11.27. That hierarchy was not the same as the hierarchy set out in IFRS 13, and therefore the disclosures provided by a financial institution or retirement benefit plan applying FRS 102 would not be directly comparable to those provided by an entity applying EU-adopted IFRS. The SORPs for Authorised Funds, Investment Trust Companies and Pension Schemes require, or permit, additional disclosure from entities within their scope in order to improve this comparability. It was also noted that some financial institutions previously applied FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which required disclosure according to a fair value hierarchy that is consistent with IFRS 13, and therefore for these entities FRS 102 had introduced a departure from IFRS. B34D.12 This amendment left an inconsistency within FRS 102, whereby the hierarchy then described in paragraph 11.27 for the purposes of determining a process for estimating fair values was no longer consistent with the hierarchy used for disclosure purposes in Section 34. B34D.13 As part of the Triennial review 2017 amendments, this issue was reviewed and further feedback from respondents was received. As discussed in paragraphs B11.42 to B11.47, only minor changes were made to paragraph 11.27 as part of moving it to paragraph 2A.1 of a new appendix Fair value measurement to Section 2, for example to emphasise that it is a methodology and give further practical guidance. B34D.14 Amendments to the relevant SORPs were not necessary before any changes to FRS 102 could take effect because a change in accounting standards after a SORP has been issued means that any inconsistent provisions of a SORP cease to have effect.
