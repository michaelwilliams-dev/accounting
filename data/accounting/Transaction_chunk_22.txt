live system. It also allows developers to test that their applications conform to the rules governing the format of messages that can be accepted by the Transaction Engine. The test service provides sufficient functionality to enable developers to submit documents and receive reports on their progress through the system in the same way as in the live version of the system. The test service is located at https://test-transaction-engine.tax.service.gov.uk/submission. The Test Service imposes a number of constraints on the client document submissions. In some cases these are not consistent with the live Transaction Engine service: Every effort will be made to keep the behaviour of the live Transaction Engine and the Test Service consistent. From time to time minor discrepancies may occur as the result of ongoing maintenance. Submissions to the Test Service that include the optional GatewayTest element must have its value set to "1".
