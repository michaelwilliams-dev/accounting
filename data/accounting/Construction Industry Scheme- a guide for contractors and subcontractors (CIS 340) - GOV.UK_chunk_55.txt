from subcontractors paid under deduction. Deductions at the standard rate Examples D1 to D3 show deductions at the standard rate of 20% which was the rate in force at the time of writing this guide. Example D1 Where no materials are supplied (‘labour-only’) A labour-only subcontractor does work on site for £200 Total payment £200 Amount deducted at 20% = £40 Net payment to subcontractor £160 The contractor calculates the deduction (£40), which has to be paid to our accounts oﬃce. The labour-only subcontractor receives the balance of £160. Entries on the contractor’s monthly return In example D1, the contractor should enter the following amounts in the appropriate boxes on the contractor’s monthly return: Total payment £200 Direct cost of materials used £0 Amount deducted £40 Example D2 The following is an example of a calculation where materials as well as labour are supplied (‘supply and fix’) and the contractor has paid the subcontractor’s expenses. Where the subcontractor is not registered for VAT, any VAT they had to pay on materials should be included in the cost of materials when calculating the CIS deduction. Where expenses, for example accommodation, mobile phone and fuel costs are paid to the subcontractor, the amounts should be included in the subcontractor’s gross payment. A tiling subcontractor, who is not VAT-registered, agrees to tile a wall and to supply the necessary materials for a total payment of £540. The materials cost the subcontractor a total of £240 (£200 + £40 for VAT). The subcontractor is also paid accommodation costs of £50 and fuel of £10. Labour charge £300 Materials £240 Accommodation and fuel £60 Amount due (invoice amount) £600 Calculation of deduction Total payment £600 Less cost of materials (inclusive of VAT) £240 Amount liable to deduction £360 Amount deducted at 20% £72 Net payment
