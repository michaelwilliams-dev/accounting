liabilities A contingent liability is either a possible but uncertain obligation or a present obligation that is not recognised because it fails to meet one or both of the conditions (b) and (c) in paragraph 16.5. A micro-entity shall not recognise a contingent liability as a liability, except for provisions for contingent liabilities of an acquiree in a trade and asset acquisition (see Section 14 Business Combinations and Goodwill). Paragraph 16.19 sets out the disclosure requirements for a contingent liability. When a micro-entity is jointly and severally liable for an obligation, the part of the obligation that is expected to be met by other parties is treated as a contingent liability. Contingent assets A micro-entity shall not recognise a contingent asset as an asset. However, when the flow of future economic benefits to the micro-entity is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset, and its recognition is appropriate. Disclosures A micro-entity shall disclose information in relation to financial commitments, guarantees and contingencies not recognised in the statement of financial position in accordance with the relevant appendix to Section 6 Notes to the Financial Statements. A micro-entity is not required to disclose the amount of a contingent liability when the possibility of an outflow of resources is remote. Appendix to Section 16 Examples of recognising and measuring provisions This appendix accompanies, but is not part of, Section 16. It provides guidance for applying the requirements of Section 16 in recognising and measuring provisions. All of the micro-entities in the examples in this appendix have 31 December as their reporting date. In all cases, it is assumed that a reliable estimate can be made of any outflows expected. In some examples the circumstances described may have resulted in impairment of the assets; this aspect is not dealt with
