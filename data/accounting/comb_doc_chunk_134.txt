Example 3 Outsourcing arrangement Facts Company E has outsourced elements of its finance function, which are now provided by Company F. Company F uses a standard finance system for all its clients (Company F is not reliant on business from Company E), and provides data in a way which interfaces with the systems retained by Company E. FRS 5 Although further details of the arrangement would need to be considered, it is likely that Company E would account for this as an operating cost. Company F would not show a lease, but would account for any fixed assets. FRS 102 This outsourcing arrangement appears to be a contact for services that does not transfer the right to use the assets (Company Fâ€™s finance system) from Company F to Company E, for example because Company F uses it to provide services to a large number of clients. A contract for services would be accounted for as an operating cost. For outsourcing arrangements that are contracts for services (ie they do not confer a right to use assets) there is unlikely to be any change in accounting when applying FRS 102 for the first time. Accounting for finance leases Initial recognition SSAP 21|FRS 102| At the inception of the lease the sum to be recorded as both an asset and a liability should be the present value of the minimum lease payments, derived by discounting them at the interest rate implicit in the lease. (SSAP 21 paragraph 32) In practice the fair value of the asset will often be a sufficiently close approximation to the present value of the minimum lease payments and may in these circumstances be substituted for it.
