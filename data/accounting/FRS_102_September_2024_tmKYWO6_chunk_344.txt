economic incentive to exercise its right, an entity shall account for the contract as either a lease or a financing arrangement depending on the relationship between the amount that the entity may be required to pay to repurchase the asset and its original selling price, as specified in paragraphs 23.92(a) or 23.92(b). Measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation For each performance obligation satisfied over time in accordance with paragraphs 23.81 to 23.84, an entity shall recognise revenue over time by measuring its progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. An entity shall select a method of measuring progress that depicts the entity’s performance in transferring control of goods or services promised to a customer (ie the satisfaction of the performance obligation). An entity shall apply a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time and shall apply that method consistently to similar performance obligations and in similar circumstances. At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall remeasure its progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation satisfied over time and update its measure of progress. Such changes to an entity’s measure of progress shall be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with paragraphs 10.14D to 10.18. In determining a method of measuring progress, an entity shall consider the nature of the good or service that the entity will transfer to the customer. Appropriate methods of measuring progress include methods that recognise revenue based on: measurements of the value to the customer of the goods or services transferred to date relative to the remaining goods or services to be transferred under the contract (referred to as output methods); and the entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation relative to the total expected inputs
