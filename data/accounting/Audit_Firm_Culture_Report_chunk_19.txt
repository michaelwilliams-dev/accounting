common and underlying themes in the barriers to professional scepticism and challenge: Barrier|What can impede good audit behaviours?| Time and/or lack of resource|Heavy workloads, tight timelines and demanding deadlines reduces the time and space auditors have to ‘step back’ to exercise scepticism and challenge and apply good judgement. It can also lead to reluctance to challenge audited entities, for fear of further pressure, performance reprisals, or delays, and the time senior auditors have to spend with and coach junior colleagues. Sustained periods of intense working can lead to a vicious cycle of staff churn as auditors get ‘burnt out’, with negative impacts on quality, which many senior auditors feel is exacerbated by lower morale caused by negative media attention placing even more pressure on the industry. This also means that newcomers have less time to ‘bed in’ and get up to speed, meaning that there are gaps in their knowledge that might prevent them from understanding the importance of quality, challenge and scepticism to the firm, or having the time and space to focus on these priorities and behaviours.| Embedding new ways of working|Where hybrid working is felt to have created a skew towards written communication rather than direct contact (e.g. via email or Microsoft Teams rather than face-to-face or telephone interaction), even when colleagues are working together in an office, this can result in less rapport and effective team working. This, in turn, can inhibit quality, challenge and scepticism. When not embedded effectively, hybrid working is felt to have lessened junior auditors’ exposure to senior colleagues and audited entities (e.g. senior colleagues failing to invite junior auditors to observe calls with the audited entity). This is felt to have reduced opportunities to learn from senior auditors, particularly if they are modelling positive behaviours, and can mean that they have
