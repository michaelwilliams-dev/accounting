Paragraph 26.10 provides guidance on determining the fair value of the shares used in determining the weighted average share price. The entity shall derive an estimate of expected volatility consistent with the valuation methodology used to determine the fair value of the shares. Modifications to the terms and conditions on which equity instruments were granted An entity might modify the terms and conditions on which equity instruments are granted in a manner that is beneficial to the employee, for example, by reducing the exercise price of an option or reducing the vesting period or by modifying or eliminating a performance condition. Alternatively, an entity might modify the terms and conditions in a manner that is not beneficial to the employee, for example, by increasing the vesting period or adding a performance condition. The entity shall take the modified vesting conditions into account in accounting for the share-based payment transaction, as follows: If the modification increases the fair value of the equity instruments granted (or increases the number of equity instruments granted) measured immediately before and after the modification, the entity shall include the incremental fair value granted in the measurement of the amount recognised for services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted. The incremental fair value granted is the difference between the fair value of the modified equity instrument and that of the original equity instrument, both estimated as at the date of the modification. If the modification occurs during the vesting period, the incremental fair value granted is included in the measurement of the amount recognised for services received over the period from the modification date until the date when the modified equity instruments vest, in addition to the amount based on the grant date fair value of the original equity instruments, which is recognised over the
