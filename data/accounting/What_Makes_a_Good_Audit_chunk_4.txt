and engagement teams before an audit commences, such as decisions to tender, accept (or continue) an audit engagement. These are important steps for both an engagement team and the audit firm. Every firm and team must ensure that they have no conflicts of interest or threats to independence that cannot be properly mitigated and that they only undertake audits for which they have the skills, capabilities and capacity to deliver to the required standards. There are also various preconditions for accepting an audit, without which an engagement cannot be accepted. These include management accepting their responsibilities for preparing financial statements, necessary internal controls and providing the auditor with information. Being clear on this from the beginning is important for delivery of a good quality audit. The FRC defines high-quality audits as those that: provide investors and other stakeholders with a high-level of assurance that financial statements give a true and fair view; comply with both the spirit and the letter of auditing regulations and standards; are driven by a robust risk assessment, informed by a thorough understanding of the entity and its environment; are supported by rigorous due process and audit evidence, avoid conflicts of interest, have strong quality management, and involve the robust exercise of professional judgement and professional scepticism; challenge management effectively and obtain sufficient audit evidence for the conclusions reached; and report unambiguously the auditorâ€™s conclusion on the financial statements. An audit is a dynamic and complex activity with many inter-related activities. The requirements and obligations of an auditor in respect of each phase of the audit are set out in International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and in the FRC Ethical Standard. Meeting the requirements in those standards is fundamental to a good audit, and full compliance with those standards is always expected. Figure 1
