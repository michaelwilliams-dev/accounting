or more goods or services promised in a contract are inputs to a combined item or items and are therefore not distinct include, but are not limited to, the following: The entity provides a significant service of integrating the goods or services with other goods or services promised in the contract into a bundle of goods or services that represent the combined output or outputs for which the customer has contracted. In other words, the entity is using the goods or services as inputs to produce or deliver the combined output or outputs specified by the customer. A combined output or outputs might include more than one phase, element or unit. An example is a construction contract when an entity provides an integration (or contract management) service to manage and co-ordinate the various construction tasks necessary for the construction of an asset. One or more of the goods or services significantly modifies or customises, or is significantly modified or customised by, one or more of the other goods or services promised in the contract. An example is a software contract when an entity promises to provide existing software and to customise that software, if the customisation service significantly modifies the software. The goods or services are highly interdependent or highly interrelated. In other words, each of the goods or services is significantly affected by one or more of the other goods or services in the contract. For example, in some cases, two or more goods or services are significantly affected by each other because an entity would not be able to fulfil its promise by transferring each of the goods or services independently. If a good or service promised to a customer is not distinct, an entity shall combine that good or service with other goods or services in the
