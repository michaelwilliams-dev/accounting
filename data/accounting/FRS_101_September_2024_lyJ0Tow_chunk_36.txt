Specifically, and subject to certain conditions: Pursuant to section 279 of the Companies Act 2014, relevant holding companies are permitted to prepare ’Companies Act entity financial statements’ and/or ‘Companies Act group financial statements’ in accordance with US GAAP, as modified to ensure consistency with Irish company law. Investment companies subject to Part 24 of the Companies Act 2014 or the European Communities (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) Regulations 2011 (SI No. 352 of 2011) may adopt an alternative body of accounting standards, being standards which apply in the United States of America, Canada or Japan in preparing ‘Companies Act entity or group financial statements’ or ’Companies Act entity financial statements’ respectively. Such entities, therefore, may adopt standards other than those issued by the FRC in preparing Companies Act financial statements under Irish company law.
