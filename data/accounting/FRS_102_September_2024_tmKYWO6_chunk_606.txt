from stakeholders suggested that the cost of obtaining a fair value for an investment property that is rented to another group entity far outweighs the benefit, as the information is of little use when the investment property would be treated as property, plant and equipment in the consolidated financial statements. B16.3 To address this significant implementation issue, an accounting policy choice was introduced for entities that rent investment property to another group entity, whereby they can choose to measure that investment property either at cost (less depreciation and impairment) or at fair value. B16.4 A small number of respondents were concerned about the impact of the change on the small number of properties for which a reliable measure of fair value is not available. The FRC notes that prior to the introduction of FRS 102 such properties were required to be measured at open market value and that Section 2A Fair Value Measurement provides guidance on situations when a reliable measure of fair value is not available. Investment property held under a lease B16.5 Prior to the Periodic Review 2024 amendments, Section 16 Investment Property applied to property held by a lessee under a finance lease and could be applied to property held under an operating lease, if certain criteria were met. As part of the Periodic Review 2024 amendments, the FRC introduced an on-balance sheet lease accounting model based on IFRS 16 Leases, which removed the distinction between finance leases and operating leases for a lessee, amongst other changes (see B20 Section 20 Leases). Consequential amendments were made to Section 16 that bring all leases for which right-of-use assets are recognised in scope of Section 16 if the other criteria for accounting for the property as investment property are met. This approach is similar to the approach taken in
