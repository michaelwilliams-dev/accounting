An entity may additionally choose to recognise intangible assets separately from goodwill for which condition (a) and only one of (b) or (c) above is met. When an entity chooses to recognise such additional intangible assets, this policy shall be applied to all intangible assets in the same class (ie having a similar nature, function or use in the business), and must be applied consistently to all business combinations. Licences are an example of a category of intangible asset that may be treated as a separate class, however, further subdivision may be appropriate, for example, where different types of licences have different functions within the business. Internally generated intangible assets 18.8A To assess whether an internally generated intangible asset meets the criteria for recognition, an entity classifies the generation of the asset into: a research phase; and a development phase. 18.8B If an entity cannot distinguish the research phase from the development phase of an internal project to create an intangible asset, the entity treats the expenditure on that project as if it were incurred in the research phase only. 18.8C In some cases, expenditure is incurred that does not meet the criteria for recognition as part of an internally generated intangible asset, for example because there is no intangible asset that can be recognised in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraph 18.8H, or because the costs cannot be distinguished from the cost of developing the business as a whole. An entity shall recognise expenditure on the following items as an expense and
