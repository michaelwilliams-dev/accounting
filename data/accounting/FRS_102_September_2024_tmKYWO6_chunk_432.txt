In the other, the operator receives an intangible asset â€“ a right to charge for use of the infrastructure assets that it constructs (or upgrades) and then operates and maintains for a specified period of time. A right to charge users is not an unconditional right to receive cash because the amounts are contingent on the extent to which the public uses the service.

In this case borrowing costs attributable to the
