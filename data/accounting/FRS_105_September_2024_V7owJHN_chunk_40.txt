A change in the measurement basis applied is a change in an accounting policy, and is not a change in an accounting estimate. When it is difficult to distinguish a change in an accounting policy from a change in an accounting estimate, the change is treated as a change in an accounting estimate. A micro-entity shall recognise the effect of a change in an accounting estimate, other than a change to which paragraph 8.13 applies, prospectively by including it in profit or loss in: the period of the change, if the change affects that period only; or the period of the change and future periods, if the change affects both. To the extent that a change in an accounting estimate gives rise to changes in assets and liabilities, or relates to an item of equity, the micro-entity shall recognise it by adjusting the carrying amount of the related asset, liability or equity item in the period of the change. Corrections of prior period errors Prior period errors are omissions from, and misstatements in, a micro-entityâ€™s financial statements for one or more prior periods arising from a failure to use, or misuse of, reliable information that: was available when financial statements for those periods were authorised for issue; and could reasonably be expected to have been obtained and taken into account in the preparation and presentation of those financial statements. Such errors include the effects of mathematical mistakes, mistakes in applying accounting policies, oversights or misinterpretations of facts, and fraud. To the extent practicable, a micro-entity shall correct a material prior period error retrospectively in the first financial statements authorised for issue after its discovery by: restating the comparative amounts for the prior period(s) presented in which the error occurred; or if the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented,
