of the FRC’s Public Interest Entity (PIE) Auditor Registration Regulations. 10 Registration requirement 5.1(c) of the FRC’s Public Interest Entity (PIE) Auditor Registration Regulations. 5 Engagement Quality Reviewers An audit of the financial statements of a PIE is required to have an engagement quality review11 performed by an engagement quality reviewer (EQR) who is eligible for appointment as a statutory auditor and not involved in the performance of the statutory audit to which the review relates.12 The eligibility criteria determined by the FRC for an “individual who is eligible for appointment as a statutory auditor” to be appointed as an EQR for a PIE audit is different to that of a key audit partner, as the EQR is not responsible for the firm's statutory audit work. Accordingly, the FRC have determined that an EQR must be a member of an RSB and hold an appropriate qualification ("Audit Qualification") or equivalent,13 but the EQR is not required to meet any additional FRC-determined criteria. Additional Requirements In appointing an EQR to a PIE audit, the firm must also consider the requirements in ISQM (UK) 2 for the EQR to have the competence, capabilities, including sufficient time, and the appropriate authority to perform the review.14 Such considerations may include whether the individual to be appointed as EQR has: An understanding of professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements and of the firm's policies or procedures relevant to an audit engagement for a PIE. An understanding of, and recent experience relevant to, engagements of a similar nature and complexity. An understanding of the additional responsibilities of the EQR in performing and documenting the engagement quality review for an audit engagement for a PIE. Has the appropriate authority to, where necessary, challenge the significant judgments made by the engagement team. 11 ISQM (UK) 1,
