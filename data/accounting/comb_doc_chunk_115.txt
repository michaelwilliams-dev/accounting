loss immediately. Objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired includes observable data that come to the attention of the holder of the asset about the following loss events: significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor; a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; the creditor, for economic or legal reasons relating to the debtorâ€™s financial difficulty, granting to the debtor a concession that the creditor would not otherwise consider; it has become probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; and observable data indicating that there has been a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a group of financial assets since the initial recognition of those assets, even though the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets in the group, such as adverse national or local economic conditions or adverse changes in industry conditions. Other factors may also be evidence of impairment, including significant changes with an adverse effect that have taken place in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the issuer operates. An entity shall assess the following financial assets individually for impairment: all equity instruments regardless of significance; and other financial assets that are individually significant. An entity shall assess other financial assets for impairment either individually or grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics. Impairment of trade debtors Objective evidence Under FRS 102, to recognise an impairment loss there must be objective evidence that the loss has occurred (ie there will be an impact on the expected future cash flows associated with the debtor), and that this is a result of one or more past events. Losses expected to arise as a result of future events may not be recognised.
