previous earnings and tax deducted to date on the FPS 5.12.2 Order for the continuation of employment A tribunal may order: that an employeeÕs employment must continue whilst it deals with a complaint of unfair dismissal specify the amount that the employer must pay the employee Such amounts count as gross pay for National Insurance contributions but for PAY E purposes these payments are taxable on amounts over £30,000 only. For National Insurance contributions purposes Follow the guidance in paragraph Ô5.12.1 Reinstatement order or re-engagement orderÕ under ÔPayment made to an employeeÕ or ÔPayment made to a directorÕ, as appropriate. For PAY E purposes You should: treat the employee as a new employee Ñ read tell HMRC about a new employee operate PAY E procedures at the week or month number that you make any payments, do not include their previous earnings and tax deducted to date on the FPS 5.12.3 Pay due under a protective award A tribunal may decide that an employer has broken some rules in making, or proposing to make, an employee redundant. If so, it can order the employer to pay the employee for a certain period. This is called the Ôprotected periodÕ. Amounts paid under a protective award count as gross pay for both National Insurance contributions and PAY E purposes. For National Insurance contributions purposes Payment made to an employee Where you make a payment under a protective award to an employee: you must treat it as a separate payment and not add it to any other payment of earnings you make to the employee at the same time assess the amount of National Insurance contributions due on the payment using an earnings period which is the longer of: the protected period that part of the protected period in respect of which the payment is made a week use this earnings period no matter how you make the payment, that is, in a lump sum or by instalments use the category letter, National Insurance percentages rates and earnings limits current at the time you make payment (or when the payment is due to be made if nothing is actually paid because of adjustments to the gross amount by the tribunal) record the payment, National Insurance contributions details and any other information, on the employeeÕs payroll record in the tax week or month in which you make payment Ñ this means that if you make another payment of earnings to the employee at the same time, youÕll have 2 lots of entries for the same tax week or month Example An employee is made redundant on 31 October. The employer pays their wages up to 30 November. A tribunal decides the: protected period is 31 October to 31 December (62 days) employer must pay the employee their wages for the period 1 December to 31 December (31 days) Assess the amount of National Insurance contributions due on the wages paid for the period 1 November to 31 December using a 62-day earnings period, as this is the longer period of: the protected period (62 days) that part of the protected period in respect of which the payment is made (31 days) a week (7 days) For guidance on how to work out the National Insurance contributions using this 62-day earnings period, read section Ô1.
