As a result, no amendments to FRS 101 itself were necessary; however, an additional paragraph (paragraph A2.7E) was included in Appendix II Note on legal requirements. IAS 36 Impairment of assets Disclosure exemptions for cash-generating units In May 2013, the IASB amended IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. At the time, FRS 101 already allowed disclosure exemptions for qualifying entities from paragraphs 134(d) to 134(f) and 135(c) to 135(e) of IAS 36. These disclosures relate to cash-generating units that, either individually or in combination, have a significant amount of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives allocated to them. These exemptions were only permitted if equivalent disclosures were included in the consolidated financial statements of the group. The IASB amended the disclosure requirements of paragraph 130(f) in relation to fair value, when fair value less costs of disposal is the recoverable amount of an individual asset or cash-generating unit. On balance, it was considered that the additional detailed disclosure requirements of paragraph 130(f) of IAS 36 are unlikely to provide relevant information to users of the financial statements of qualifying entities, given that general information on impairments will be disclosed through the requirements of paragraphs 130(a) to (e). In addition, this detailed information would be available in the consolidated financial statements, and if no disclosure is made in the consolidated financial statements on the grounds of materiality, the relevant disclosures would need to be made at subsidiary level.14 However, it was noted that should an exemption be introduced for paragraph 130(f) in its entirety, basic information about the basis of measurement of the fair value would be lost, and an imbalance between the disclosure requirements relating to fair value less costs of disposal and value in use would exist. Therefore in conclusion: an exemption was not introduced from the requirements
