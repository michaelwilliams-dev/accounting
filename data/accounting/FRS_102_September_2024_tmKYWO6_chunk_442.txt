cash, its policies for disposing of such assets or for retaining them. Defined benefit plans – actuarial liabilities A defined benefit plan is not required to recognise a liability in relation to the promised retirement benefits. A defined benefit plan shall disclose, in a report alongside the financial statements, information regarding the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits including: a statement of the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits, based on the most recent valuation of the scheme; the date of the most recent valuation of the scheme; and the significant actuarial assumptions made and the method used to calculate the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits. Heritage Assets Heritage assets shall be accounted for in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs 34.50 to 34.56. In determining whether an asset is a heritage asset, the entity’s management shall use its judgement to assess the characteristics of the asset and whether it is held and maintained principally for its contribution to knowledge and culture. For example: works of art and similar objects are sometimes held by commercial entities but are not heritage assets because they are not maintained principally for their contribution to knowledge and culture; and an investment property is unlikely to be a heritage asset because it is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both. A An asset with characteristics of a heritage asset, but which is used by the entity itself, for example historic buildings used for teaching by education establishments, shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable other section of this FRS rather than this section. However, an entity is encouraged to provide the disclosures set out in paragraphs 34.55 and 34.56 in respect of that asset, in addition to the disclosures required by that section.
