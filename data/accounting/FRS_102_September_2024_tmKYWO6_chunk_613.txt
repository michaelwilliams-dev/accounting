Simplifications Leases of low-value assets B20.8 As exceptions to the general on-balance sheet accounting model, FRS 102, like IFRS 16, provides recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The FRC concluded that a key contributor to making the on-balance sheet model proportionate for FRS 102 preparers would be to take a more permissive approach to defining low-value assets. As a result, Section 20 focuses on ensuring that the most significant leased assets (examples of which are listed in paragraph 20.11) are recognised on-balance sheet, but allows some flexibility for preparers to determine whether or not other assets are of low value. An entity wishing to set the threshold at a lower level (eg for consistency with a group accounting policy) is able to do so. B20.9 Like IFRS 16, Section 20 defines low-value assets in absolute terms, not in relation to what is material to the lessee. Similarly, like IFRS 16, Section 20 permits the recognition exemption to be applied to low-value assets regardless of whether the total of those low-value assets is material to the lessee. B20.10 Because Section 20 focuses on highlighting examples of assets which are not of low value, no list of examples of low-value assets has been provided. However, IFRS 16 states that examples of low-value assets can include tablet and personal computers, small items of office furniture and telephones. Application of the recognition exemption to, at least, leases of such assets under Section 20 would therefore be acceptable. B20.11 The FRC expects that, as a result of this greater flexibility in defining low-value assets, FRS 102 preparers will be able to apply the on-balance sheet lease accounting model to a smaller proportion of their
