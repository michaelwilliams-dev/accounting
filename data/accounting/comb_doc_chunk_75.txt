calculating the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest of a similar loan. The second component, ie the gift or contribution to the borrower, is the measurement difference which is accounted for as a capital contribution or distribution. The accounting is demonstrated in the numerical examples below. A parent provides a fixed term interest-free loan of CU1,000 to its subsidiary. The present value of the loan using a market rate of interest for a similar loan is CU9002. The difference of CU100 represents an additional investment by the parent in the subsidiary. The parent would record the following accounting entries in its individual financial statements: Dr||Loan receivable from subsidiary3|CU900| Dr| Cr|Investment in subsidiary3 Cash|CU100 CU1,000| The subsidiary would record the following accounting entries: Dr Cash CU1,000 Cr Loan repayable to parent CU900 Cr Capital contribution (equity) CU100 A subsidiary provides a fixed term interest-free loan of CU1,000 to its parent. The present value of the loan using a market rate of interest for a similar loan is CU9002. The difference of CU100 is a distribution to the parent. The parent would record the following accounting entries in its individual financial statements: Dr Cash CU1,000 Cr Loan repayable to subsidiary CU900 Cr Distribution received from subsidiary (profit or loss)4 CU100 The subsidiary would record the following accounting entries: Dr||Loan receivable from parent|CU900| Dr| Cr|Distribution to parent (equity)5 Cash|CU100 CU1,000| 2 See Example 6 below for the calculation of the present value and a demonstration of the subsequent accounting for an interest-free loan. 3 Loans and investments are subject to impairment. An entity shall apply the relevant accounting requirements in FRS 102 to determine whether a loan or investment is impaired. 4 Company law requires that only profits realised at the reporting date are included in
