provided the interest rate of the loan is a market rate of interest (see Staff Education Note 16 Financing transactions for the measurement requirements applying to loans with a below market rate of interest)). Amortisation period In order to calculate the effective interest rate, an entity has to determine the expected life of the debt instrument. A shorter period than the expected life should be used under certain circumstances. This is typically the case when certain fees, finance charges or other transaction costs relate to a period shorter than the expected life of the debt instrument (paragraphs 11.16 and 11.18 of FRS 102). On transition, entities should assess whether amortisation periods used to calculate the effective interest rate are in accordance with the requirements of FRS 102. Generally no accounting difference is expected, however, in some specific situations, eg debts with early redemption options differences may arise. Measurement of common debt instruments Overdraft repayable on demand If a creditor has the right to demand repayment at any time, the borrower measures the liability at the undiscounted amount of cash repayable. A standard bank overdraft repayable on demand would be measured at the principal amount of the overdraft. Current trade debtors (receivables) and trade creditors (payables) Under FRS 102, trade receivables (debtors) and trade payables (creditors) are recognised at the transaction price (unless the arrangement is a financing transaction as described in paragraph 11.13 of FRS 102, see Staff Education Note 16 for more detail), which in most cases is the invoiced amount (refer to the examples in paragraph 11.13 of FRS 102). In accordance with paragraph 11.14(a) of FRS 102 receivables and payables due within one year continue to be measured after their initial recognition at the undiscounted amount of cash or other consideration expected to be paid or received.
