measurement requirements of FRS 102. Required amendments – Retrospective restatement Paragraph 35.7 of FRS 102 requires an entity to: recognise all assets and liabilities whose recognition is required by FRS 102 (eg forward exchange contracts); not recognise items as assets or liabilities if FRS 102 does not permit their recognition; reclassify items (eg into different groupings in the cash flow statement); and restate certain assets and liabilities at a different value (eg financial instruments measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate, which in some cases may vary from a previously used historical cost). Paragraph 35.8 of FRS 102 states that adjustments on transition shall be recognised in retained earnings, or where appropriate, another category within equity. For example, an entity with a date of transition of 1 January 2014 is required to reassess all its assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2013 and make any adjustments that are necessary to recognise and measure them in accordance with FRS 102. Exceptions to retrospective restatement Paragraph 35.9 of FRS 102 states that on first-time adoption of FRS 102, an entity shall not retrospectively change the accounting that it followed under its previous financial reporting framework for any of the following transactions: Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities: Financial assets and liabilities derecognised under an entity’s previous accounting framework before the date of transition shall not be recognised upon adoption of this FRS. Conversely, for financial assets and liabilities that would have been derecognised under this FRS in a transaction that took place before the date of transition, but that were not derecognised under an entity’s previous accounting framework, an entity may choose: to derecognise them on adoption of this FRS; or to continue to recognise them until disposed of or settled.
