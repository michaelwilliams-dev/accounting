Deadlines for filing accounts Unless you are filing your company�s first accounts, the time normally allowed for delivering accounts to Companies House is: 9 months from the accounting reference date, for a private company 6 months from the accounting reference date, for a public company 5.1 Definition of a �month� for accounts A period of months after a given date ends on the corresponding date in the appropriate month. Example A private company with an accounting reference date of 4 April has until midnight on 4 January of the following year to deliver its accounts (not 31 January). This does not apply if your accounting reference date is the last day of the month. In this case the period allowed for filing accounts would end with the last day of the appropriate month. Example A private company with an accounting reference date of 30 April has until midnight on 31 January of the following year to deliver its accounts (not 30 January). If a filing deadline falls on a Sunday or Bank Holiday, the law still requires you to file the accounts by that date. To avoid a penalty, make sure you send acceptable accounts in time to arrive before the deadline. It�s the date that you deliver acceptable accounts to Companies House (which meet the relevant legal requirements) that is important - not the date that you sent the accounts. 5.2 Deadlines for filing your company�s first accounts If you are filing your company�s first accounts and those accounts cover a period of more than 12 months, you must deliver them to Companies House: within 21 months of the date of incorporation for private companies, or 3 months from the accounting reference
