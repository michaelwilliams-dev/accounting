This could occur, for example, when a subsidiary becomes subject to the control of a government, court, administrator or regulator. Disposal – where control is lost A Where a parent ceases to control a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (or in the income statement, if presented) calculated as the difference between: the proceeds from the disposal (or the event that resulted in the loss of control); and the proportion of the carrying amount of the subsidiary’s net assets, including any related goodwill, disposed of (or lost) as at the date of disposal (or date control is lost). The cumulative amount of any exchange differences that relate to a foreign subsidiary recognised in equity in accordance with Section 30 Foreign Currency Translation is not recognised in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal of the subsidiary and shall be transferred directly to retained earnings. B The gain or loss arising on the disposal shall also include those amounts that have been recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary, where those amounts are required to be reclassified to profit or loss upon disposal in accordance with other sections of this FRS. Amounts that are not required to be reclassified to profit or loss upon disposal of the related assets or liabilities in accordance with other sections of this FRS shall be transferred directly to retained earnings. If an entity ceases to be a subsidiary but the investor (former parent) continues to hold: an investment that is not an associate (see paragraph 9.19(b)) or a jointly controlled entity (see paragraph 9.19(c)), that investment shall be accounted for as a financial asset in accordance with Section 11 Basic Financial Instruments or Section 12 Other Financial Instruments Issues
