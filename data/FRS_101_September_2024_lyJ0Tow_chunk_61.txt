place on each of the various requirements, requiring that entities aggregate/disaggregate as appropriate. So although the disclosure requirements are extensive, there is scope for entities to apply judgement in their preparation. 12 As set out in the Appendix I Glossary, separate financial statements are included in the meaning of individual financial statements. In the 2014/15 cycle, it was proposed that a more detailed review of IFRS 15 be deferred until the 2015/16 cycle, given that the effective date was not until 1 January 2018 and the EU endorsement was still incomplete. In the 2015/16 cycle, it was noted that there would be greater interest from the users of the financial statements of a qualifying entity in information supporting the statement of financial position, rather than the income statement, and as a result disclosure exemptions from the second sentence of paragraph 110, and paragraphs 113(a), 114, 115, 118, 119(a) to (c), 120 to 127 and 129 of IFRS 15 were introduced. It was noted that qualifying entities are still required to provide the following disclosure requirements: company law requirements relating to disaggregation of turnover (which are reflected in paragraph A2.11B); and IAS 1 contains requirements relating to judgements having a significant effect on the amounts recognised in an entityâ€™s financial statements. For the avoidance of doubt, paragraph 117 (from which a qualifying entity is not exempt) cross-refers to paragraph 119. It is not necessary to comply with paragraph 119 in order to meet the requirements of paragraph 117. IFRS 16 Leases In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases superseding IAS 17 Leases. This standard was considered in the 2016/17 cycle. Single lease disclosure note Paragraph 52 of IFRS 16 requires a lessee to provide all lease disclosures in a single note or separate section in the financial statements, although
