Interest is charged when the amount due is settled. Interest is shown as accruing from day 19 of each month, regardless of how the employer pays. Employers who pay electronically will see an accrued interest entry between day 19 and day 22 a month. Once the electronic payment is received, the calculation will correctly use day 22 as the due date, and any interest charge generated between day 19 and day 22 will be cancelled.
