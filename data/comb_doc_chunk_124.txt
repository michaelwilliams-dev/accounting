and FRS 102. Subsequent Measurement Depreciation and separate components FRS 15|FRS 102| Requires the depreciable amount of the tangible asset to be allocated on a systematic basis over its useful economic life. (FRS 15 paragraph 77) Notes that the fundamental objective of depreciation is to reflect in operating profit the cost of use of the tangible fixed assets in the period. (FRS 15 paragraph 78) Provides that where the tangible fixed asset comprises two or more major components with substantially different useful economic lives, each component should be accounted for separately for depreciation purposes and depreciated over its individual useful economic life. (FRS 15 paragraph 83)|Requires an entity to allocate the depreciable amount of an asset on a systematic basis over its useful life. (FRS 102 paragraph 17.18) Requires that if the major components of an item of property, plant and equipment have significantly different patterns of consumption of economic benefits, an entity shall allocate the initial cost of the asset to its major components and depreciate each such component separately over its useful life. Other assets shall be depreciated over their useful lives as a single asset. (FRS 102 paragraph 17.16)| Both standards require similar application of a components approach in calculating depreciation; both are based on the consumption of the asset. Example Depreciation of major components On 1 January 20X1, Co A acquired an item of machinery for CU500,000. The machine is made up of two components of equal value; the computer processing unit and the mechanical parts. Management estimate that the computer processing unit has a useful life of 5 years and the mechanical parts have a useful life of 10 years. Management also estimates that the straight-line method best reflects the pattern in which the entity expects to consume the future economic benefits of all components
