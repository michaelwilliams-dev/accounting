where audit findings can be escalated by all auditors in a safe environment, where auditors feel they are being included in a team and where there is sufficient time for the team members to support each other, discuss and resolve findings before an audit is signed off. Mechanisms that lend themselves to flatter hierarchies, such as open-plan office spaces, create a good environment for challenge and help to create a sense of team culture.

Senior auditors should promote the art of learning from mistakes and encourage a culture of continual improvement. The more confident auditors feel about challenging themselves, the more likely they will learn from mistakes and therefore make continual improvements. This is a powerful means to get exceptional results, particularly when a firm’s audit engagement partners lead by example. Audit firms need to create the right environment for scepticism and challenge within a hybrid working context. This includes firms identifying factors that may be more difficult in a hybrid working environment (for example, how to challenge when not face to face; how to best learn from others when not physically together) and developing effective ways of working to overcome these potential barriers.
