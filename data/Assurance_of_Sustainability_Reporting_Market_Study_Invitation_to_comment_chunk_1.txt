Audit firms may provide sustainability assurance as well as statutory audit. In recent years, audit firms have reported facing capacity constraints. This is of interest to the FRC given our strategic objective to create a more resilient audit market through greater competition and choice. Audit firms are only one type of supplier of sustainability assurance; if they supplied less, this might enhance supply of audit. Given some audit firms supply sustainability assurance, we conducted an initial review of this market in 2023, which showed potential for issues to emerge. Some stakeholders raised concerns about the extent of choice and diversity of supplier (audit and non-audit firms), and how this might change. We heard concerns about whether there is sufficient capacity to meet current, and future, demand for sustainability assurance. Queries
