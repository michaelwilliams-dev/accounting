the previously expected date, and reassessing the useful life of an asset as finite rather than indefinite. Evidence is available from internal reporting that indicates that the economic performance of an asset is, or will be, worse than expected. In this context economic performance includes operating results and cash flows. If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, this may indicate that the entity should review the remaining useful life, the depreciation (amortisation) method or the residual value for the asset and adjust it in accordance with the section of this FRS applicable to the asset (eg Section 17 Property, Plant and Equipment and Section 18 Intangible Assets other than Goodwill), even if no impairment loss is recognised for the asset. Measuring recoverable amount The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, references to an asset in paragraphs 27.12 to 27.20A should be read as references also to an asset’s cash-generating unit. It is not always necessary to determine both an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If either of these amounts exceeds the asset’s carrying amount, the asset is not impaired and it is not necessary to estimate the other amount. If there is no reason to believe that an asset’s value in use materially exceeds its fair value less costs to sell, the asset’s fair value less costs to sell may be used as its recoverable amount. This will often be the case for an asset that is held for disposal. Fair value less costs to sell Fair value less costs to sell is a measurement based
