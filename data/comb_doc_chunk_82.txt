accounting entries set out in Example 2 above when a parent makes an interest-free loan to its subsidiary. As described in Example 2, at initial recognition the interest-free loan is accounted for as a loan at a market-rate of interest and a capital contribution or distribution. After initial recognition the interest-free loan is treated for accounting purposes as if it was a loan at a market rate of interest with capital and interest payable at the end of the term of the loan. Interest is accounted for applying the effective interest method. The entity receiving interest (in this example the parent) records it as income. Income is recorded in total comprehensive income, either in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income. Company law prohibits the inclusion of unrealised profits within profit or loss, except for an unrealised revaluation gain arising from the application of fair value accounting. If the interest income is considered a realised profit it is recorded in profit or loss, otherwise it is recorded in other comprehensive income. An entity that is a company should assess whether the interest income is a realised profit within the meaning of company law. The determination of realised profits in accordance with company law is a complex area where accounting and legal requirements interface. This factsheet does not address company law issues that may be relevant in this regard. An entity may refer to Technical Release 02/17BL, or any successor document. An entity may also wish to take specialist legal advice. The entity paying interest (in this example the subsidiary) records it as an expense in profit or loss. 13 900 is a rounded figure.
