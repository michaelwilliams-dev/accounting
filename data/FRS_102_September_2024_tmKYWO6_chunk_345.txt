to satisfy the performance obligation (referred to as input methods). Common methods, and circumstances when they may be appropriate, include: an output method based on surveys of work completed, when the surveys provide an objective measure of an entity’s performance to date; an output method based on units delivered, when each item transfers an equal amount of value to the customer on delivery and partly-completed items are not significant; an output method based on time elapsed, when control of the goods or services is transferred evenly over time; an input method based on time elapsed, when an entity’s efforts or inputs are expended evenly throughout the performance period; an input method based on costs incurred, when the method includes costs that reflect an entity’s performance to date and contribute to the entity’s progress in transferring control of goods or services promised to a customer; and an input method based on labour hours expended, when there is a relationship between labour hours expended and the transfer of control of goods or services to a customer. If an entity has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity’s work to date (eg a service contract in which an entity bills a fixed amount for each hour of service provided), the entity may recognise revenue in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice. If an entity cannot reasonably measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation (eg in the early stages of a contract), but the entity expects to recover the costs incurred in satisfying that performance obligation, the entity shall recognise revenue only to the extent of the costs incurred.
