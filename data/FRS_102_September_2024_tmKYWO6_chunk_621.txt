performance outcome. However, this approach would have required a research project to be undertaken and caused delay to the finalisation of FRS 102. An alternative approach would have been to align FRS 102 with EU-adopted IFRS and defer a research project on the accounting for grants until after the publication of FRS 102. However, respondents noted that some entities, mainly in the public benefit entity sector, already applied the performance model and that reverting to the accruals model would introduce a change for these entities. The FRC did not wish to implement a change for entities that might subsequently be reversed, therefore FRS 102 permits a choice between the performance model and accruals model. B24.3 As part of the Triennial Review 2017 it was noted that inconsistency in practice has continued, and without an internationally accepted solution this is likely to continue. Therefore although the FRC would like to improve consistency of accounting in this area, the time is not right for significant change. B24.3A As part of the Periodic Review 2024, the FRC considered this issue again. The two models available in FRS 102 align to the two IFRS-based solutions: IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance (which requires the accrual model) and the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard (which requires the performance model). No changes are expected in the medium term to those IFRS-based solutions, and hence international consistency is not imminent. Therefore, the FRC decided not to remove either of the models at this time. Grants from other sources B24.4 Respondents further commented that as Section 24 Government Grants is restricted to government grants, grants received by public benefit entities from other sources will be accounted for in accordance with Section 34 Specialised Activities, and there is now the possibility that the accounting
