Paragraph 42(2) of Schedule 1 to the Regulations requires entities to present the notes to the accounts in the order in which, where relevant, the items to which they relate are presented in the balance sheet and in the profit and loss account. Although the requirement of IFRS 16 does not conflict with the Regulations, it would result in unnecessary additional work that would provide minimal additional benefits to the users of the financial statements.

FRS 101 provides an exemption from the requirements of IFRS 7 for non-financial institutions, provided equivalent disclosures are included in the consolidated financial statements of the group. Therefore, a lessee could take an exemption from paragraph 58 of IFRS 16 by virtue of its cross-reference to IFRS 7, whereas lessors could not, as no similar cross-reference to IFRS 7 exists.

It was concluded that consistency is important and qualifying entities should not have different reporting burdens for economically similar transactions. Given that no
