changes in circumstances. To account for changes in the estimate of the transaction price, an entity shall allocate any changes to performance obligations in the contract on the same basis as at contract inception. Consequently, an entity shall not reallocate the transaction price to reflect changes in stand-alone selling prices after contract inception. Amounts allocated to a performance obligation that has been satisfied shall be recognised as revenue, or as a reduction of revenue, in the period in which the estimate of the transaction price changes. A change in transaction price as a result of a contract modification arises from separate and subsequent negotiation between the parties to the contract that changes the enforceable rights and obligations of those parties. Such a change shall be accounted for in accordance with paragraphs 23.13 to 23.16. However, in subsequently applying paragraph 23.76 for a change in the transaction price that occurs after a contract modification: when the modification is accounted for as if it were a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract, an entity shall allocate the change in the transaction price to the performance obligations identified in the contract before the modification to the extent that the change in the transaction price is attributable to an amount of variable consideration promised before the modification; and in all other cases in which the modification is not accounted for as a separate contract in accordance with paragraph 23.15, an entity shall allocate changes in transaction price to the performance obligations in the modified contract that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied immediately after the modification. Step 5 â€“ Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation An entity shall recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good
