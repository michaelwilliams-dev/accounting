whereas under FRS 102, no gain or loss is recognised and goodwill is not adjusted; instead the transaction is treated as a transaction with equity holders. Example 2 Company A disposed of a proportion of its shares in Company B on 31 December 20X1 for CU100m in cash, reducing its holding from 80% to 60%. The carrying amount of the identifiable net assets of Company B in the consolidated financial statements was CU200m at that date. The carrying amount of goodwill attributable to the acquisition of Company B was CU40m at the date of disposal. FRS 2 A gain of CU50m is recognised on disposal in the consolidated financial statements: CUm Proceeds received 100 Carrying amount of identifiable net assets (inc. goodwill) attributable to group after disposal (60% x CU200m) + (60/80 x CU40m) Carrying amount of identifiable net assets (inc. goodwill) attributable to group before disposal (80% x CU200m) + CU40m 150 250 (200) Gain 50 The carrying amount of goodwill is reduced by CU10m (20/80 x CU40m). The non-controlling interestâ€™s share in the net assets of Company B will increase from 20% to 40%, ie it will increase from CU40m (20% x CU200m) to CU80m (40% x CU200m). No goodwill is attributable to the non-controlling interest. FRS 102 No gain or loss is recognised on this disposal; instead it is treated as a transaction between equity holders. As with FRS 2, the non-controlling interest will increase from 20% to 40%, ie it will increase from CU40m to CU80m. The carrying amount of goodwill is not adjusted as a result of the disposal.
