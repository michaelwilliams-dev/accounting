A small number of senior auditors felt that particularly during this busy season, audit managers are having to choose between providing effective coaching and ensuring they complete audit engagements within the timeline. In these cases, they felt managers may choose to complete tasks themselves as they would find it faster than coaching someone more junior through the process. This means that junior auditors can be given less opportunities to learn how to exercise scepticism and challenge during these periods. “[Coaching] is the cause of a heavy workload. You are trying to do work but also teach the team.” (Assistant manager / Manager) Workload reducing the quality of formal training Heavy workloads and resourcing issues were also felt to impact the effectiveness of formal training. For several audit managers and above, this feels particularly true as training is not accounted for in workload and capacity discussions. They therefore felt less able to prioritise attendance at training when they are up against tight deadlines or managing multiple engagements at once. If they do decide to attend the training sessions during these busy periods, these auditors felt they are less engaged in the content as they are often completing other work at the same time to ensure they meet their engagement deadlines. “Senior staff just don’t have time to give us the training.
