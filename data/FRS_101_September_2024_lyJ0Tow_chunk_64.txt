a more detailed consideration of this standard is required and it was deferred until the 2018/19 cycle. Conflicts with company law – Companies Act accounts only Presentation – primary statements 61B As noted in paragraph 4A of FRS 101, individual financial statements prepared by companies in accordance with FRS 101 are Companies Act accounts and not IAS accounts and therefore must comply with the requirements of the Act and any relevant regulations, such as SI 2008/410, The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the Regulations). 61C For Companies Act accounts (but not IAS accounts), the form and content of individual accounts of insurance companies are required to comply with Schedule 3 to the Regulations.

However, it concluded that the approach and methodology that underpins IFRS
