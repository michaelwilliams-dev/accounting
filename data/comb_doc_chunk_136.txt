lease obligations on initial recognition more carefully. However, in cases where the fair value of the leased asset was deemed a sufficiently close approximation to the present value of the minimum lease payments, there is unlikely to be a material difference between the two. For most leases, the date of inception of the lease in accordance with SSAP 21 and the date of the commencement of the lease term in accordance with FRS 102 will be the same. However, it is possible, that the timing of the initial recognition of the asset and lease obligation will differ on application of FRS 102. For example, if a lessee signs a lease agreement on 1 January 20X1 but cannot start using the lease until 1 June 20X1, under FRS 102, the inception date would be 1 January 20X1 but the commencement date would be 1 June 20X1. The asset and lease obligation would not be recognised until the commencement date of 1 June 20X1. Under SSAP 21, the asset and lease liability would be recognised on 1 January 20X1. Accounting for operating leases Operating lease incentives UITF 28|FRS 102| Operating lease incentives for lessors (a reduction against rental income) and lessees (a reduction against rental expense) should be allocated over the lease term or a shorter period ending on the date from which it is expected the prevailing market rental will be payable. The allocation should be on a straight line basis unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the benefit receivable/received from the use of the asset.
