following: The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale. Its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it. Its ability to use or sell the intangible asset. How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, the entity can demonstrate the existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset. The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset. Its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. 18.8I In the development phase of an internal project, an entity can, in some instances, identify an intangible asset and demonstrate that the asset will generate probable future economic benefits. This is because the development phase of a project is further advanced than the research phase. 18.8J Examples of development activities are: The design, construction and testing of pre-production or pre-use prototypes and models. The design of tools, jigs, moulds and dies involving new technology. The design, construction and operation of a pilot plant that is not of a scale economically feasible for commercial production. The design, construction and testing of a chosen alternative for new or improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services. K Where an entity adopts a policy of capitalising expenditure in the development phase that meets the conditions of paragraph 18.8H, that policy shall be applied consistently to all expenditure that meets the requirements of paragraph 18.8H. Expenditure that does not meet the conditions of paragraph 18.8H is expensed as incurred. Initial measurement An entity shall measure an intangible asset initially
