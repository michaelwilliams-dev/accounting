Evidence that a financial asset could be impaired includes the following events: significant financial difficulty of the debtor; a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; the creditor, for economic or legal reasons relating to the debtor’s financial difficulty, granting to the debtor a concession that the creditor would not otherwise consider; it has become probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; declining market values of the asset or similar assets; significant changes with an adverse effect on the asset that have taken place in the technological, market, economic or legal environment; and the contract has become an onerous contract. A micro-entity shall measure an impairment loss for financial assets as set out below. An impairment loss is immediately recognised in profit or loss.

When the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the net cash flows shall be the present value of the estimated net cash flows. The discount rate shall be the asset’s current contractual interest rate. Reversal A micro-entity shall reverse
