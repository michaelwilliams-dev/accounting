contract because the micro-entity no longer derives a benefit from it.| Derecognition of a financial asset A micro-entity shall derecognise a financial asset only when: the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are settled; the micro-entity transfers to another party substantially all of the risks (eg slow or non-payment risk) and rewards of ownership (eg future cash flows from a debtor); or when no future economic benefits are expected from holding it or its disposal. A micro-entity shall recognise any gain or loss on the derecognition of a financial asset in profit or loss when the item is derecognised. If a micro-entity received any proceeds from the transfer of a financial asset, but the conditions in paragraph 9.21 are not met, a micro-entity shall continue to recognise the asset in its entirety and shall recognise a financial liability for the consideration received. The asset and liability shall not be offset. In subsequent periods, the micro-entity shall recognise any income on the transferred asset and any expense incurred on the financial liability. Example 1: Debt factoring arrangement that qualifies for derecognition| A micro-entity sells a group of its accounts receivable to a bank at less than their carrying amount. The micro-entity is obliged to remit promptly to the bank all amounts collected, but it has no obligation to the bank for slow payment or non-payment by the debtors. In this case, the micro-entity has transferred to the bank substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the receivables. Accordingly, it removes the receivables from its statement of financial position (ie derecognises them), and it shows no liability in respect of the proceeds received from the bank. The micro-entity recognises a loss calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the receivables at
