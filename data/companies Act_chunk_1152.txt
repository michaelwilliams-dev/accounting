is an agreement for the acquisition of, or of an interest in, shares to which the offer relates, it includes provisions imposing obligations or restrictions on any one or more of the parties to it with respect to their use, retention or disposal of such shares, or their interests in such shares, acquired in pursuance of the agreement (whether or not together with any other shares to which the offer relates or any other interests of theirs in such shares), and it is not an excluded agreement (see subsection (5)). An agreement is an “excluded agreement”— if it is not legally binding, unless it involves mutuality in the undertakings, expectations or understandings of the parties to it, or if it is an agreement to underwrite or sub-underwrite an offer of shares in a company, provided the agreement is confined to that purpose and any matters incidental to it. The reference in subsection (4)(b) to the use of interests in shares is to the exercise of any rights or of any control or influence arising from those interests (including the right to enter into an agreement for the exercise, or for control of the exercise, of any of those rights by another person).
