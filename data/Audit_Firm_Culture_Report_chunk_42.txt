are less clear. Consequently, most partners felt that, at their level, there has been a positive movement away from linking pay and annual bonuses solely to financial contribution, towards a position where much greater importance is also placed on delivering quality audits. This, combined with the fear of penal repercussions connected to a poor-quality audit outcome from a regulatory review, is felt to be a strong motivator for partners to achieve quality, scepticism and challenge. While they are aware that scepticism and challenge do not need to be judged as empirically as quality in performance reviews, most feel that they are key contributors to achieving high-quality scores overall when properly implemented. They therefore place great importance on modelling scepticism and challenge in their audit teams, ultimately reinforcing these behaviours. “Previously, reward for us was almost exclusively linked to economic contribution to the firm, but in recent years they have been effective in changing the dial, so it is more focussed on quality, so you really have to think about how scepticism and challenge are being employed on your jobs.” (Partner) Focusing on quality in discussions around progression for senior auditors Likewise, most of those in manager and more senior positions recognised that expectations around quality are now ingrained into progression and promotion conversations. The impact of this is believed to have been twofold: It has made the inclusion of quality assessments in performance reviews far more meaningful, as they are often now the cornerstone of appraisal conversations. It has made feedback on desired audit behaviours far more regular. However, it was still felt that these tended to be rolled into general feedback on quality during the appraisal process, aside from a few instances where proactive line managers did push for them to be surfaced more explicitly in these conversations.
