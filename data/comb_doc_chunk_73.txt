It should be noted that in some cases a distribution may be recorded in the financial statements in accordance with FRS 102, although it may not be a distribution as a matter of law and vice versa. An entity that is subject to company law should consider whether the distribution recorded in the financial statements for reporting purposes is also a distribution as a matter of the law and, if so, should assess whether it has sufficient distributable profits to make the distribution.
