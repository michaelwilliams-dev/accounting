an integral part of the related hardware and it is treated as property, plant and equipment. The same applies to the operating system of a computer or mobile device. When the software is not an integral part of the related hardware, the software is treated as an intangible asset. Recognition General principle for recognising intangible assets An entity shall recognise an intangible asset as an asset if, and only if: it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity; and the cost or value of the asset can be measured reliably. A This section uses the term ‘asset’ in a way that differs in some respects from the definition of an asset in paragraph 2.33 and Appendix I Glossary. For the purposes of this section, an asset is a resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity. An entity shall assess the probability of expected future economic benefits using reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management’s best estimate of the economic conditions that will exist over the useful life of the asset. An entity uses judgement to assess the degree of certainty attached to the flow of future economic benefits that are attributable to the use of the asset on the basis of the evidence available at the time of initial recognition, giving greater weight to external evidence. The probability recognition criterion in paragraph 18.4(a) is always considered satisfied for intangible assets that are separately acquired. Acquisition as part of a business combination Intangible assets acquired in a business combination shall be recognised separately from goodwill when all the following three conditions are satisfied: the recognition criteria set out in paragraph 18.4 are
