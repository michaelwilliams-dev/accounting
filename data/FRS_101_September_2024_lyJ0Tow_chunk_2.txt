FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework This FRS sets out an optional reduced disclosure framework which addresses the financial reporting requirements and disclosure exemptions for the individual financial statements of subsidiaries and ultimate parents that otherwise apply the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of adopted IFRS. Disclosure exemptions are available to a qualifying entity, as defined in the glossary to this FRS, in its individual financial statements (but not in consolidated financial statements which it is required or voluntarily chooses to prepare). However, a qualifying entity which is a financial institution is not exempt from the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement to the extent that they apply to financial instruments, and paragraphs 134 to 136 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. A qualifying entity may apply the reduced disclosure framework regardless of the financial reporting framework applied in the consolidated financial statements of the group. Financial statements prepared by a qualifying entity in accordance with this FRS are not accounts prepared in accordance with adopted IFRS. A qualifying entity must ensure it complies with any relevant legal requirements applicable to it. For example, individual financial statements prepared by companies in accordance with this FRS are Companies Act accounts and not IAS accounts
