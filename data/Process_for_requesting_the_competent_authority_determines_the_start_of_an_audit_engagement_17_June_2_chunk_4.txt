Where two or more businesses combine to form a “new” PIE or audit firm, the FRC will look for evidence that one of the combining entities has a more dominant role than others. The stronger the evidence of a dominant entity, the less the likelihood that the FRC will conclude that it and the entity post the combination should be treated as distinct entities for the purposes of Article 17. In other words the FRC is likely to conclude that a dominant entity and the post combination entity should be considered as if they were the same entity, regardless of the legal form or accounting mechanisms used to structure the arrangements. Becoming a PIE for the first time A further cause of possible uncertainty concerns establishing the date on which an entity became a PIE for the first time. In general this is the date on which the entity became an insurer or bank, or had securities admitted to trading on a regulated market for the first time. Some have suggested, however, that unlisted insurers and banks (who meet the revised definition of a PIE under the Statutory Auditors and Third Country Auditors Regulations 2016 (SATCAR) but were not
