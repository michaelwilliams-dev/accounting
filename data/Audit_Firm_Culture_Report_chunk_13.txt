to pin down a precise time frame for this change in the profession, or to attribute this to specific events or interventions. For senior auditors, the perceived recent and growing emphasis on audit quality felt like a significant culture shift away from what they saw as a more conciliatory, commercially- focussed relationship with audited entities (still referred to as ‘clients’ by most of the sampled research participants). “There’s been a big change since I’ve been a partner even. We don’t get asked ‘are you bringing X or Y to the table’ anymore, we get asked ‘are you proud of the work you do’ and ‘what or who might make you leave.’” (Partner) Typically, those at manager level and above saw audit quality and the specific behaviours of professional scepticism and effective challenge as being clearly and integrally linked – and had a good, shared understanding of these terms – though throughout the research were more likely to talk about quality in general terms than scepticism and challenge specifically. “Quality is always talked about as being a big focus that we should be thinking about at all times.” (Assistant manager / Manager) Those at more junior levels also had a good understanding of the term professional scepticism, which they defined in terms of ‘stepping back’ and ‘questioning’, but often found it more challenging to explain or give examples for the term effective challenge. At this level, there was also less of an understanding of the ways these two behaviours influenced overall audit quality (and how firm values and desired behaviours might correlate with quality). “We [first year associates] are always being told to ask questions about why things are the way they are, actively looking for support to help the team get to the bottom of issues in the numbers.” (Associate
