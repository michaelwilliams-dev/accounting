was the holder of shares of that description at the close of business on a date to be specified in the offer. The specified date must fall within the period of 28 days immediately before the date of the offer. Saving for other restrictions on offer or allotment The provisions of this Chapter are without prejudice to any other enactment by virtue of which a company is prohibited (whether generally or in specified circumstances) from offering or allotting equity securities to any person. Where a company cannot by virtue of such an enactment offer or allot equity securities to a holder of ordinary shares of the company, those shares are disregarded for the purposes of section 561 (existing shareholders' right of pre-emption), so that— the person is not treated as a person who holds ordinary shares, and the shares are not treated as forming part of the ordinary share capital of the company. Saving for certain older pre-emption requirements In the case of a public company the provisions of this Chapter do not apply to an allotment of equity securities that are subject to a pre-emption requirement in relation to which section 96(1) of the Companies Act 1985 (c. 6) or Article 106(1) of the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 (S.I. 1986/1032 (N.I. 6)) applied immediately before the commencement of this Chapter. In the case of a private company a pre-emption requirement to which section 96(3) of the Companies Act 1985 or Article 106(3) of the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 applied immediately before the commencement of this Chapter shall have Part 17 – A company's share capital Chapter 4 – Public companies: allotment where issue not fully subscribed Document Generated: 2025-03-12 Status: This version of this Act contains provisions that are prospective.
