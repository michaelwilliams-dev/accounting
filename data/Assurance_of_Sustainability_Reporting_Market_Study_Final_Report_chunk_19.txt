must adopt a systematic and holistic approach to any plans for the UK market for sustainability assurance. This should start with the development of an overarching supervisory framework for sustainability assurance, comprised of: a regulatory framework which provides oversight and monitoring, and a professional framework and ethical code for sustainability assurance providers that covers, for example, requirements for competence and accreditation, independence, a system of quality management and professional liability mechanisms”.26 24 ISQM 1 refers to the International Standard on Quality Management 1 published by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. 25 ISO 9001 is an internationally recognised quality management standard developed by the International Standards Organisation. 26 See Deloitte submission to the FRC dated 28 November 2024; available at: https://www.frc.org.uk/consultations/assurance-of-sustainability-reporting-market-study/ Forvis Mazars told us that “all providers should be subject to the same standards for providing assurance […] as well as being subject to the same rigorous quality inspection and enforcement regime”.27 In addition to improving the consistency of high-quality assurance, stakeholders suggested that an accreditation regime could improve trust in the quality of assurance in the market. Through accreditation and quality assessments, buyers of assurance could be more confident in the quality of services being offered by various providers in the market. Stakeholders also suggested such a regime would enable wider stakeholders, such as investors, to place greater reliance on the information being assured. A further benefit to the creation of an accreditation regime in the UK is that it may enable UK parent companies with EU subsidiaries to report under CSRD at the group level and take exemptions for its subsidiaries. This exemption is available if the assurance opinion on the consolidated sustainability reporting is provided by a person or firm authorised to provide such an opinion under UK law. Currently, no such authorisation regime exists
