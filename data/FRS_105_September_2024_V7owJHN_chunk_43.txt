and Investment Property respectively). A When a micro-entity sells goods or services and expects, at contract inception, that payment will be deferred both for more than 12 months and beyond normal credit terms, the transaction price is the cash price available on the date of the transaction (see Section 18). Example – Transaction price when payment is deferred| A micro-entity sells goods to a customer for CU100. Customers are usually required to pay within 14 days of the invoice date, but the micro-entity agrees with the customer that payment will be deferred for one year. The micro-entity sells the same item for CU90, if payment is received within the usual credit terms. The cash price for the goods and thereby the transaction price is CU90.| Transaction costs shall be added to the cost of a financial asset or shall be deducted from the cost of a financial liability, unless they are not material in which case they are recognised immediately as an expense in profit or loss. Examples – Transaction costs| 1|A micro-entity receives a bank loan of CU500. The bank charges CU5 in arrangement fees. The micro-entity determines that the transaction costs are immaterial and recognises them immediately in profit or loss as an expense. The cost of the loan is CU500.| 2|A micro-entity is making an investment and buys shares in another entity for CU1,000. The micro-entity incurs legal fees and other transaction costs totalling CU100. The micro-entity determines that the transaction costs are material and includes them in the cost of the investment. The total cost of the investment is CU1,100.| 3|A micro-entity takes out a forward foreign currency exchange contract and is charged a fee of CU30. The micro-entity determines that the transaction costs are material. The total cost of the forward foreign currency exchange contract
