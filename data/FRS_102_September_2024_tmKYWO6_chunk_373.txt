on fair value. Section 2A Fair Value Measurement provides guidance on fair value measurement. A When determining an asset’s fair value less costs to sell, consideration shall be given to any restrictions on the sale or use of that asset. Costs to sell shall include the cost of obtaining relaxation of a restriction when necessary in order to enable the asset to be sold. However, if a restriction would also apply to any potential purchaser of an asset, that restriction may instead affect the fair value of the asset, as set out in paragraph 2A.4. Costs to sell shall not include factors that have already been taken into account when determining the fair value of an asset. Value in use Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset. This present value calculation involves the following steps: estimating the future cash inflows and outflows to be derived from continuing use of the asset and from its ultimate disposal; and applying the appropriate discount rate to those future cash flows. The following elements shall be reflected in the calculation of an asset’s value in use: an estimate of the future cash flows the entity expects to derive from the asset; expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those future cash flows; the time value of money, represented by the current market risk-free rate of interest; the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in the asset; and other factors, such as illiquidity, that market participants would reflect in pricing the future cash flows the entity expects to derive from the asset. In measuring value in use, estimates of future cash flows shall include: projections of cash inflows from the continuing use of the asset; projections of cash outflows that
