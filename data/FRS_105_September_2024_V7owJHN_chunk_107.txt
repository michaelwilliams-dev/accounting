an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If either of these amounts exceeds the asset’s carrying amount, the asset is not impaired and it is not necessary to estimate the other amount. If there is no reason to believe that an asset’s value in use materially exceeds its fair value less costs to sell, the asset’s fair value less costs to sell may be used as its recoverable amount. This will often be the case for an asset that is held for disposal. Fair value less costs to sell Fair value less costs to sell is a measurement based on fair value. Paragraph 2.36 provides further guidance on determining fair value. When determining an asset’s fair value less costs to sell, consideration shall be given to any restrictions on the sale or use of that asset. Costs to sell shall include the cost of obtaining relaxation of a restriction when necessary in order to enable the asset to be sold. However, if a restriction would also apply to any potential purchaser of an asset, that restriction may instead affect the fair value of the asset. Cost to sell shall not include factors that have already been taken into account when determining the fair value of an asset. Value in use Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset. This present value calculation involves the following steps: estimating the future cash inflows and outflows to be derived from the continuing use of the asset and from its ultimate disposal; and applying the appropriate discount rate to those future cash flows. In measuring value in use, estimates of future cash flows shall include: projections of cash inflows from the continuing use of the asset; projections
