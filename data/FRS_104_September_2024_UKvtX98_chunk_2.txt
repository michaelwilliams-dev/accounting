FRS 104 Interim Financial Reporting FRS 104 Interim Financial Reporting is based on IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting; it is not an accounting standard1. It does not require any entity to prepare an interim report, nor does it change the extent to which laws or regulations may require the preparation of such a report. Entities should consider whether any such laws or regulations apply to them. For example, paragraph 4.2.2R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTRs) requires listed entities within the scope of that rule to prepare a half-yearly financial report that must include a condensed set of financial statements, such as the interim financial report described in FRS 104. Similarly, AIM companies are required under the AIM Rules for Companies issued by the London Stock Exchange to prepare a half-yearly report. When an entity prepares an interim financial report, FRS 104 does not, in itself, require such reports to be prepared in accordance with FRS 104. However, laws or regulations may contain such a requirement. Paragraph 4.2.10R of the DTRs sets out that UK issuers within the scope of that rule which do not apply UK-adopted international accounting standards in their annual financial statements
