of materiality, it shall be recognised that interim measurements may rely on estimates to a greater extent than measurements of annual financial data. As described in paragraphs 2.11 to 2.13 of FRS 102, materiality is an entity-specific aspect of relevance that depends on the nature or magnitude of information, or both. An entity assesses whether information, either individually or in combination with other information, is material in the context of its financial statements taken as a whole. While judgement is always required in assessing materiality, this FRS bases the recognition and disclosure decision on data for the interim period by itself for reasons of understandability of the interim figures. Thus, for example, unusual items, changes in accounting policies or estimates, and errors are recognised and disclosed on the basis of materiality in relation to interim period data to avoid misleading inferences that might result from non-disclosure. The overriding goal is to ensure that an interim financial report includes all information that is relevant to understanding an entity’s financial position and performance during the interim period. 26–27 [Deleted] Recognition and measurement Same accounting policies as annual An entity shall apply the same accounting policies in its interim financial statements as are applied in its most recent annual financial statements, except for accounting policy changes made after the date of the most recent annual financial statements that are to be reflected in the next annual financial statements. 28A The frequency of an entity’s reporting (annual, half-yearly or quarterly) shall not affect the measurement of its annual results, with the exception described in paragraph 30(a). To achieve that objective, measurements for interim reporting purposes shall be made on a year-to-date basis. Year-to-date measurements may involve changes in estimates of amounts reported in prior interim periods of the current financial year, but the principles
