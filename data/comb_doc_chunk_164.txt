at the contracted forward rate of £1:$1.62 (£61,728) and the year end forward rate £1:$1.59 (£62,893) giving a loss of £1,165. 5 For simplicity, the loss is calculated as the difference between $100,000 at the settlement date spot rate of £1:$1.55 (£64,516) and $100,000 at the y/e forward rate of £1:$1.59 (£62,893) giving a loss of £1,623. 6 $100,000 at the contracted forward rate of £1:$1.62.

The differences arise due to the timing of recognition of the loss on the derivative: SSAP 20 Option 2 – the loss is recognised on settlement; and FRS 102 – the loss is recognised in the period in which it occurs. The total loss on the derivative of £2,788 represents the exchange difference arising on $100,000 translated at the contracted rate (£1: $1.62) and the spot rate on the date of settlement (£1:$1.55), ie if the entity had not taken out the forward contract, it would have received £2,788 more cash on settlement of the debtor. The net loss from currency movements is £772 (1,194 - 1,165 + 822 - 1,623), which is equal to the exchange difference arising on $100,000 translated at the spot rate (£1:$1.6) and the forward rate at 1 November 201X (£1:$1.62).
