Tax-advantaged schemes You should register new tax-advantaged schemes by 6 July following the tax year they were set up. If you miss this deadline, you’ll need to follow the late registration process (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/late-registrations-for-employment-related-securities).

If the options are granted after 6 April 2024, you must tell us by 6 July following the end of the tax year in which the grant is made. Non tax-advantaged schemes You only need to register schemes without a tax advantage when there’s a reportable event, for example acquiring or disposing of securities, or assigning or releasing securities options. You should register your non tax-advantaged scheme by 6 July following the tax year when the first reportable event happened.
