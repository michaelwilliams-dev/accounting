remote meetings (e.g. audit managers and junior auditors being invited to calls that feel useful for them to observe). Where remote or hybrid working was not embedded effectively, it was felt to reduce scope for socialising and face-to-face interactions in most firms, including asking informal questions or simply getting to know other auditors and developing positive working relationships. “Every person learns from the person ahead of them. It's about the time that you spend with the team.” (Senior manager / Director) Time pressures limiting the building and improving of working relationships As in other areas, such as communication, time and resourcing pressures were cited as a key barrier to building effective working relationships and psychological safety, and auditors’ ability to exercise scepticism and challenge as a result. Heightened pressure during an audit has a significant impact on working relationships, leading to negative emotions (e.g. stress, anger, frustration) across all levels, making communication either more strained or colleagues more likely to misinterpret the tone of internal challenge or responses to it, which can impact the perceived openness of colleagues to challenge. There was also particular frustration with senior colleagues being seen to be willing to exert internal pressure on the audit team relating to deadlines, but not on the audited entity. Some audit managers described finding it challenging to balance the people management and coaching element of their role, including reviewing and feeding back on juniors’ work, with their own extensive task-list. There was a feeling it can be harder to make time to connect with and support junior colleagues during busy periods, with some managers resorting to editing and changing work without reviewing or feeding back to save time. In addition to lacking face-to-face feedback, some associates reported feeling they are often under actual or unspoken pressure from senior colleagues
