outside experts to assist in the annual calculations. Making similar estimates at interim dates often entails updating of the prior annual provision rather than the engaging of outside experts to do a new calculation. Pensions A2.42 Section 28 of FRS 102 requires an entity to determine the present value of defined benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets at the end of each reporting period. FRS 102 does not require an entity to involve a professionally qualified actuary in the measurement of the obligations nor does FRS 102 require an annual comprehensive actuarial valuation. For interim reporting purposes, the defined benefit obligation can often be reliably measured by extrapolation of the latest actuarial valuation adjusted for changes in employee demographics such as number of employees and salary levels. Income taxes A2.43 Entities may calculate income tax expense and deferred income tax liability at annual dates by applying the tax rate for each individual jurisdiction to measures of income for each jurisdiction. Paragraph A2.16 acknowledges that while that degree of precision is desirable at interim reporting dates as well, it may not be achievable in all cases, and a weighted average of rates across jurisdictions or across categories of income is used if it is a reasonable approximation of the effect of using more specific rates. Contingencies A2.44 The measurement of contingencies may involve the opinions of legal experts or other advisers. Formal reports from independent experts are sometimes obtained with respect to contingencies. Such opinions about litigation, claims, assessments, and other contingencies and uncertainties may or may not also be needed at interim dates. Revaluations and fair value accounting A2.45 Section 17 Property, Plant and Equipment of FRS 102 allows an entity to choose as its accounting policy the revaluation model whereby items of property, plant and equipment
