A resolution moved in contravention of this section is void, whether or not its being so moved was objected to at the time. But where a resolution so moved is passed, no provision for the automatic reappointment of retiring directors in default of another appointment applies. For the purposes of this section a motion for approving a person's appointment, or for nominating a person for appointment, is treated as a motion for his appointment. Nothing in this section applies to a resolution amending the company's articles. Validity of acts of directors The acts of a person acting as a director are valid notwithstanding that it is afterwards discovered— that there was a defect in his appointment; that he was disqualified from holding office; that he had ceased to hold office; that he was not entitled to vote on the matter in question. This applies even if the resolution for his appointment is void under section 160 (appointment of directors of public company to be voted on individually).
