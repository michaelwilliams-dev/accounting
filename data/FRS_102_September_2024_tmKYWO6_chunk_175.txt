contractual cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability can change: by amending the contractual terms specified at the initial recognition of the financial instrument (for example, the contractual terms are amended to replace the referenced interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate); in a way that was not considered by – or contemplated in – the contractual terms at the initial recognition of the financial instrument, without amending the contractual terms (for example, the method for calculating the interest rate benchmark is altered without amending the contractual terms); and/or because of the activation of an existing contractual term (for example, an existing fallback clause is triggered). 11.20C As a practical expedient, an entity shall apply paragraph 11.19 to account for a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability that is required by interest rate benchmark reform. This practical expedient applies only to such changes and only to the extent the change is required by interest rate benchmark reform (see also paragraph 11.20D). For this purpose, a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if, and only if, both these conditions are met: the change is necessary as a direct consequence of interest rate benchmark reform; and the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the basis immediately preceding the change. 11.20D Examples of changes that give rise to a new basis for determining the contractual cash flows that is economically equivalent to the basis immediately preceding the change are: the replacement of an existing interest rate benchmark used to determine the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability with an alternative benchmark rate – or the
