constructive obligation at the reporting date to carry out the restructuring. Contingent liabilities A contingent liability is either a possible but uncertain obligation or a present obligation that is not recognised because it fails to meet one or both of the conditions (b) and (c) in paragraph 21.4. An entity shall not recognise a contingent liability as a liability, except for certain contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination (see paragraphs 19.15F and 19.24A). Disclosure of a contingent liability is required by paragraph 21.15 unless the possibility of an outflow of resources is remote. When an entity is jointly and severally liable for an obligation, the part of the obligation that is expected to be met by other parties is treated as a contingent liability. Contingent assets An entity shall not recognise a contingent asset as an asset. Disclosure of a contingent asset is required by paragraph 21.16 when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. However, when the flow of future economic benefits to the entity is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset, and its recognition is appropriate. Disclosures Disclosures about provisions ^ 21.14 For each class of provision, an entity shall disclose the following: a reconciliation showing: the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the period; additions during the period, including adjustments that result from changes in measuring the discounted amount; amounts charged against the provision during the period; and unused amounts reversed during the period; a brief description of the nature of the obligation and the expected amount and timing of any resulting payments; an indication of the uncertainties about the amount or timing of those outflows; and the amount of any expected reimbursement, stating the amount of any asset that has been recognised for that expected reimbursement.
