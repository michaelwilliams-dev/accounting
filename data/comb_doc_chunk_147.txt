assets. Grants relating to revenue are recognised in income on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity recognises the related costs for which the grant is intended to compensate. (Note: A grant that becomes receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the entity with no future related costs shall be recognised in income in the period in which it becomes receivable.) Grants relating to assets are recognised in income on a systematic basis over the expected useful life of the asset. (FRS 102 paragraphs 24.5C to 24.5F)| Example Grant towards a fixed asset Facts A manufacturing company receives a government grant of £200,000 as an incentive to open a factory in a region of high unemployment. There are no further conditions associated with the grant, other than that it is used to pay for the construction of this factory. In the same year as receiving the grant, the company constructs the factory for a total cost of £600,000 and begins to use it. The company has a policy of depreciating buildings over a useful life of 50 years. SSAP 4 Under SSAP 4 (and taking into account company law), the grant is deferred and shown as a liability. It is then released to the profit and loss account over the expected useful life of the related asset. Given that the asset’s life is 50 years (and the company has no plans to relocate during this time), the entries are as follows: Recognition of the factory (fixed asset) Dr Fixed assets £600,000 Cr Cash £600,000 Initial recognition of the grant Dr Cash £200,000 Cr Deferred grants £200,000 Recognition of depreciation charge on the factory (£600,000 / 50 years) Dr Depreciation (P&L) £12,000 Cr Fixed assets £12,000
