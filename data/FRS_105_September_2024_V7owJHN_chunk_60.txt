a systematic basis over its useful life. Factors may indicate that the residual value or useful life of an asset has changed since the most recent annual reporting date. If such indicators are present, a micro-entity shall review its previous estimates and, if current expectations differ, amend the residual value, depreciation method or useful life. The micro-entity shall account for the change in residual value, depreciation method or useful life as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with paragraphs 8.11 to 8.13. Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, ie when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Depreciation of an asset ceases when the asset is derecognised. Depreciation does not cease when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use unless the asset is fully depreciated. However, under usage methods of depreciation the depreciation charge can be zero while there is no production. A micro-entity shall consider all the following factors in determining the useful life of an asset: The expected usage of the asset. Usage is assessed by reference to the assetâ€™s expected capacity or physical output. Expected physical wear and tear, which depends on operational factors such as the number of shifts for which the asset is to be used and the repair and maintenance programme, and the care and maintenance of the asset while idle. Technical or commercial obsolescence arising from changes or improvements in production, or from a change in the market demand for the product or service output of the asset. Expected future reductions in the selling price of an item produced using an asset could indicate the expectation of technical or commercial obsolescence of the asset. Legal or similar limits on
