may be brought into force at a future date. Changes that have been made appear in the content and are referenced with annotations. (See end of Document for details) View outstanding changes The company's obligation to maintain a register of members does not apply with respect to the period when the election is in force. This means that, during that period— the company must continue to keep a register of members in accordance with Chapter 2 (a “historic” register) containing all the information that was required to be stated in that register as at the time immediately before the election took effect, but the company does not have to update that register to reflect any changes that occur after that time. Subsections (2) and (3) apply to the index of members (if the company is obliged to keep an index of members) as they apply to the register of members. The provisions of Chapter 2 (including the rights to inspect or require copies of the register and to inspect the index) continue to apply to the historic register and, if applicable, the historic index during the period when the election is in force. The company must place a note in its historic register— stating that an election under section 128B is in force, recording when that election took effect, and indicating that up-to-date information about its members is available for public inspection on the central register. Subsections (7) and (8) of section 113 apply if a company makes default in complying with subsection (6) as they apply if a company makes default in complying with that section. The obligations under this section with respect to a historic register and historic index do not apply in a case where the election was made by subscribers wishing to form a private company.
