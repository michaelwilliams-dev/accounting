gains and losses A2.31 Foreign currency translation gains and losses are measured for interim financial reporting by the same principles as at financial year-end. A2.32 Section 30 Foreign Currency Translation of FRS 102 specifies how to translate the financial statements for foreign operations into the presentation currency, including guidelines for using average or closing foreign exchange rates and guidelines for recognising the resulting adjustments in profit or loss, or in other comprehensive income.

Entities do not anticipate future changes in foreign exchange rates in the remainder of the current financial year in translating foreign operations at an interim date. A2.33 If Section 30 of FRS 102 requires translation adjustments to be recognised as income or expense in the period in which they arise, that principle is applied during each interim period. Entities do not defer some foreign currency translation adjustments at an interim date if the adjustment is expected to reverse before the end of the financial year. Interim financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies A2.34 Interim financial reports in hyperinflationary economies are prepared by the same principles as at financial year-end. A2.35 Section 31 Hyperinflation of FRS 102 requires that the financial statements of an entity that reports in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy shall be stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period, and the gain or loss on the net monetary position is included in profit or loss. Also, comparative financial data reported for prior periods are restated to the current measuring unit. A2.36 Entities follow those same principles at interim dates, thereby presenting all interim data in the measuring unit as of the end of the interim period, with the
