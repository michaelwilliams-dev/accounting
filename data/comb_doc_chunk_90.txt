of financial position at both the date of transition (ie 1 January 2018) and the prior year end (ie 31 December 2018) will need to be restated to conform with the requirements of FRS 102. The opening statement of financial position at the date of transition does not need to be presented, however it still needs to be prepared so that the information needed for the transitional reconciliations can be determined. The income statement for the prior year (ie 31 December 2018) should also be restated and presented. Transitional reconciliations The following transitional reconciliations are required: Equity determined in accordance with its previous financial reporting framework and its equity determined in accordance with FRS 102 at: the date of transition to FRS 102 (ie in the illustration, 1 January 2018); and the end of the latest period presented in the entity’s most recent annual financial statements determined in accordance with its previous financial reporting framework (ie in the illustration, 31 December 2018). Profit or loss determined in accordance with its previous financial reporting framework for the latest period in the entity’s most recent annual financial statements to its profit or loss determined in accordance with FRS 102 for the same period (ie in the illustration, year ended 31 December 2018). FRS 102 does not prescribe the format of the transitional reconciliations. Two possible formats are illustrated below along with the associated notes, however an entity may use any suitable format taking into account the nature and amount of their own adjustments. For simplicity, these illustrations generally ignore any deferred tax impact. If an entity becomes aware of errors made under its previous financial reporting framework, the reconciliations should distinguish the correction of these errors from changes in accounting policy.
