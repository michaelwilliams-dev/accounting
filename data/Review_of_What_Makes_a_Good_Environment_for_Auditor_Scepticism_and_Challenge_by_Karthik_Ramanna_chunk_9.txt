more detailed regulations. The procedural nature of the audit may be precipitating perverse and unintended consequences on audit challenge and thus audit quality. For one, it renders audits boring, so many of the best minds might leave the profession early on, or even choose to avoid it altogether. Data from BritainThinks suggests alarming levels of employee turnover at some firms. With eyepopping employee turnover, UK audit firms are often left relying on international partner networks to fill in gaps, but such “outsourced” fixes rarely build and promote the kind of “Andon” culture described earlier. The procedural enormity of the contemporary audit also means auditors are absurdly busy, so busy in fact that they do not appear to have much mental bandwidth to reflect deeply on substantive client judgements that might necessitate challenge. Evidence from behavioural science also suggests that when people are stretched, their emotions rather than their reason guide their decision-making – and emotional auditors are also unlikely to have the dialectical sophistication I mentioned earlier, to disagree without being disagreeable. There is a temptation in the face of staff exits and chock-a-block diaries to conclude that audit firms are understaffed, and that we should increase the supply of accountants in the economy. I remain sceptical of this argument. Recent data for the UK suggests that there are about 380,000 accountants in a workforce of about 32.5 million, which is more than 1 accountant for every 1000 working members in society. While there is no objective benchmark for this statistic, it is reportedly amongst the highest in the world. Create still more accountants, and the UK risks channelling talent away from undersupplied sectors such as engineering and healthcare. Perhaps as a next step, the FRC and audit-firms’ leadership might collectively study the work patterns of existing auditors of all
