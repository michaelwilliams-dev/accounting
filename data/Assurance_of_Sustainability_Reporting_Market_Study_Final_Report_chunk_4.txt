study. Market trends In this section, we provide the latest available information for the key trends relating to the market for sustainability assurance for FTSE 350 companies. All figures in this section originally appeared in our emerging findings publication in October 2024, but have been updated with the latest available data from 2023.1 Summary Some of the main developments in the FTSE 350 sustainability assurance market are summarised below. Demand for sustainability assurance amongst FTSE 350 companies has grown by 18 percentage points since 2019 (see Figure 1). All stakeholders told us that they believed demand for sustainability assurance will continue to grow and, with the exception of the stagnation in growth between 2022 and 2023, it is poised to grow significantly in the coming years as UK multinationals seek to meet incoming assurance requirements in other jurisdictions, e.g. the EU. There is an increasing tendency amongst FTSE 350 companies to appoint an audit firm, particularly the Big Four, for the provision of sustainability assurance. The Big Four are the largest four providers of assurance in the FTSE 350 and have increased their collective market share to 40% (up from 33% in 2019, and 35% in 2022) (see Figure 3). Companies are increasingly appointing one provider, often one of the Big Four, to provide both statutory audit and sustainability assurance services. Notably, 37% of FTSE 100 companies used their statutory auditor for sustainability assurance in 2023, an increase of 12 percentage points since 2019 (see Figure 7). In 2023, ISAE 3000 was the most common assurance standard used in sustainability assurance engagements for FTSE 350 companies, with 69% of engagements referring to the ISAE 3000 standard (see Figure 9). Limited assurance remains the predominant level of assurance in the FTSE 350 across all assurance standards, with 83% of assurance engagements
