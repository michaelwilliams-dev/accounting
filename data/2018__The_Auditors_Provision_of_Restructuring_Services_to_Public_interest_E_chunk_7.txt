risks to independence If a transaction is funded by way of bonds issued on the financial markets, the auditor may only know the identity of those bondholders they are engaged by, and not the full population of bondholders. In certain circumstances, an auditor may also not know the identity of all participants in a lending syndicate (and an objective, reasonable and informed third party might also conclude that an auditor might not be expected to have such information available to them). Where this is the case, there is still a requirement for the auditor to ensure that they are independent to undertake an engagement. The auditor makes their assessment of their independence and the effectiveness of any applicable safeguards in a way that reflects the actual knowledge the auditor has about the participants in a syndicate, and in a way that is proportionate to that syndicate and those able to control it (Paragraphs 1.61, 1.64 and 1.67 of the FRC Ethical Standard refer). Actual knowledge will be informed by factors including the auditor’s knowledge of the parties to the engagement, and any public statements made by large institutional investors and asset owners on investments they might have made in any such transaction. The FRC intends that this staff guidance note provides a basis for considering how requirements are interpreted for restructuring transactions funded through bank lending syndicates or a bond issue. This guidance note applies in respect of all syndicate related engagements commencing on or after 1 April 2018.
