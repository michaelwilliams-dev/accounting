transactions; and all resulting exchange differences shall be recognised in other comprehensive income. For practical reasons, an entity may use a rate that approximates the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions, for example an average rate for the period to translate income and expense items. However, if exchange rates fluctuate significantly, the use of the average rate for a period is inappropriate. The exchange differences referred to in paragraph 30.18(c) result from: translating income and expenses at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions and assets and liabilities at the closing rate; and translating the opening net assets at a closing rate that differs from the previous closing rate. When the exchange differences relate to a foreign operation that is consolidated but not wholly-owned, accumulated exchange differences arising from translation and attributable to the non-controlling interest are allocated to, and recognised as part of, non-controlling interest in the consolidated statement of financial position. An entity whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy shall adjust its results and financial position using the procedures specified in Section 31 Hyperinflation before translating them into a different presentation currency using the following procedures: all amounts (ie assets, liabilities, equity items, income and expenses, including comparatives) shall be translated at the closing rate at the date of the most recent statement of financial position, except that when amounts are translated into the currency of a non-hyperinflationary economy, comparative amounts shall be those that are presented as current period amounts in the relevant prior period financial statements. Translation of a foreign operation into the investorâ€™s presentation currency In incorporating the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a foreign operation with those of the reporting entity, the entity shall follow normal consolidation procedures, such as the elimination of intragroup balances
