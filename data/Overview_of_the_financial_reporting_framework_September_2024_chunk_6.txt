102 were originally based on the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, modified in terms of the scope of entities eligible to apply it, the accounting treatments provided, and the required disclosures.6 The micro-entities regime (FRS 105) Micro-entities are the smallest of entities and are a subset of small entities. The accounting standard for micro-entities, FRS 105, has been developed around the legal framework and simplifies the requirements of FRS 102 for this group of entities. Although FRS 105 is the least complex standard, every entity that is eligible to apply it should consider whether the micro-entities regime meets its individual needs. It is important to remember that the regime is optional even if an entity meets the eligibility criteria. The micro-entities regime requires limited disclosures and constrains the accounting policies that can be applied: The only primary statements required are a balance sheet and profit and loss account. There is no requirement to prepare a statement of cash flows, a statement of comprehensive income or a statement of changes in equity. Further, the information presented in the balance sheet and profit and loss account is condensed (for example ‘fixed assets’ is not disaggregated into tangible fixed assets, intangible assets, investment properties etc). No assets can be measured at fair value or a revalued amount. This means that land and buildings and investment properties can only be measured at cost and previous revaluation gains would need to be removed on transition. The accounts of micro-entities in the UK7 are only required to disclose information about: Off-balance sheet arrangements; Employee numbers; Advances, credits and guarantees granted to directors; and 6 For details, refer to Significant differences between FRS 102 and the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard available at: www.frc.org.uk/library/standards-codes-policy/accounting-and-reporting/uk-accounting-standards/uk- accountingstandards-overview/significant-differences-between-frs-102-and-the-ifrs-for-smes-accounting-standard/ 7 The minimum disclosure requirements applicable to micro-entities in the Republic of
