losses attributable to changes in credit risk in other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 9 will usually be a departure from the requirement of paragraph 40 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations, for the overriding purpose of giving a true and fair view. A3.12D Entities that are preparing Companies Act accounts must provide the disclosures required by paragraph 55 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations, which sets out requirements relating to financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss. Most of these disclosures will be satisfied by equivalent requirements of FRS 102, but entities will need to take care to ensure appropriate disclosure of derivatives is provided. A3.13 An entity applying this FRS and holding financial instruments measured at fair value may be required to provide the disclosures required by paragraph 36(4) of Schedule 1 to the Regulations. The disclosures as required by paragraph 36(4) have been incorporated into Section 11. Some of the Section 11 disclosure requirements apply to all financial instruments measured at fair value, whilst others (see paragraph 11.48A of FRS 102) apply only to certain financial instruments (this does not include financial liabilities held as part of a trading portfolio nor financial liabilities that are derivatives). The disclosure requirements of paragraph 11.48A will predominantly apply to certain financial liabilities, however, there may be instances where paragraph 36(3) of Schedule 1 to the Regulations requires that the disclosures must also be provided in relation to financial assets, for example investments in subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities measured at fair value (see paragraph 9.27B of FRS 102). Requirement to present financial statements A3.14 FRS 102 does not prescribe which entities prepare financial statements and preparers should apply the requirements of the Act in determining whether financial statements (either individual or consolidated) are required.
