SSAP 21 The present value of the minimum lease payments is only 70% of the fair value of the asset at the inception of the lease, therefore, it may be classified as an operating lease1. FRS 102 Under FRS 102, the lease would pass the condition set out in paragraph 20.5(e) and so would be classified as a finance lease. 1 SSAP 21 does not rely exclusively on the ‘90% test’. Paragraph 16 of SSAP 21 notes “the presumption that a lease which fails to meet the conditions in paragraph 15 (ie including the ‘90% test’) is not a finance lease may in exceptional circumstances be rebutted”. In practice (outside this stylised example) the economics of this example are questionable and it is likely that Company A would need to consider other factors, which may result in classification as a finance lease. In which case there would be no difference in lease classification arising from application of FRS 102. Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease SSAP 21 / FRS 5|FRS 102| SSAP 21 applies only to leases ie to arrangements that meet the definition of ‘a contract between a lessor and lessee for the hire of a specific asset’. Other contracts may have some features in common with leases, but are outside the scope of SSAP 21. FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions Application Note F Private Finance Initiative and Similar Contracts may apply to these contracts – it is relevant to contracts for services, where an asset is necessary to perform the contracted services.|Some arrangements do not take the legal form of a lease but convey rights to use assets in return for payments. Examples of arrangements in which one entity (the supplier) may convey a right to use an asset to another entity (the purchaser), often
