and when the use of fair value would not be permitted by company law. The latter is expected to arise rarely. Interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts In practice this means that any interest rate swaps or forward foreign exchange contracts will be measured at fair value at each reporting date, with the change in fair value being recognised in profit or loss, unless the entity chooses to apply hedge accounting. The contract rate agreed in a forward foreign exchange contract cannot be used to measure the hedged item as it was under SSAP 20 Foreign currency translation. Key FRS 102 references 12.7 12.8 to 12.9 12.15 to 12.25A Appendix—Financing transactions Initial measurement Paragraph 11.13 of FRS 102 sets out the initial measurement requirements for financial assets and financial liabilities. Generally financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at their transaction price, which typically is the amount of cash borrowed or the invoiced amount when goods or services are sold. However, when a financial asset or financial liability, ie a receivable or payable, originates from an arrangement that is a financing transaction, that receivable or payable is measured at the present value of the future cash payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument1 (paragraph 11.13). Below are five common examples of financing transactions where the loan has a fixed repayment date to demonstrate the application of the present value measurement requirement of paragraph 11.13. It should be noted that the present value of a financial asset or financial liability that is repayable on demand is equal to the undiscounted cash amount payable reflecting the lender’s right to demand immediate repayment. 1 Debt instruments include loans receivable, loans payable, trade debtors and trade creditors.
